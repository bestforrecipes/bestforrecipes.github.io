##### Steps to make Miso-Flavored Fried Tempura (Okonomiyaki):

1.  Add ◎ to a bowl and mix it up with an egg beater instead of sifting, add the dashi stock broth a bit at a time, and mix without kneading. Dry-fry the sakura shrimp.

3.  Heat oil in a pan, and cook over medium heat. Once the sides have hardened, flip over. Press down firmly on it with a spatula, and lightly coat the top with half of the miso.
4.  Flip it over and reduce to low heat. Press down on the batter with a spatula, and lightly cover with the remaining miso.
