##### Instructions to make Recipe by the President of the Japanese Okonomiyaki Association!!

Kansai-style Okonomiyaki:

1.  Roughly mince the cabbage. Finely mince the core.
2.  Finely chop the pickled red ginger.
3.  Pour the batter onto the electric griddle at once. The okonomiyaki should be about 15-18 cm and 1-2 cm thick. Lay pork belly slices on top and cook for 2 minutes.
4.  For tempura crumbs, buy at the deli section of the supermarket instead of using leftover crumbs you made previously. It'll result in better flavor.
5.  Add 1 ladle of cake flour, 1/3 of the grated yam, 1/3 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1 ladle of kombu dashi stock to the tempura crumbs and mix together. It's best if the batter is a little thick.
6.  Add cabbage, pickled red ginger, and egg to the batter and mix it by scooping up and down with a fork to incorporate air.
7.  Pour the batter onto the hot plate at once. The okonomiyaki should be about 15-18 cm and 1-2 cm thick. Lay pork belly slices on top and cook for 2 minutes.
8.  Flip the okonomiyaki over and cook for 5 more minutes. Steam emitting from the sides is proof that it is cooking all the way through. Do not press down.
9.  Flip the okonomiyaki one more time. The pork belly slices should be nice and crispy. Leave it to cook for 3 more minutes.
10.  Don't worry about spreading the sauce on carefully, just smear a generous amount.
