##### Steps to make Oysters Raw on the Half-shell:

1.  Strike oyster shells using the blunt side of a butcher knife. Be sure to strike the opening seam while holding the oyster in the vertical position.
2.  A few strikes will render the shell slightly ajar, insert the sharp side of the blade (not the point) and pry open to a 45° angle.
3.  Use the point of your knife to separate the foot of the oyster from its shell on both sides. Use your hands to open the shell completely; discard the more shallow half of the shell.
4.  Rinse the meat and retained shell to rid them of any shell fragments and/or sand. Serve the meat on top of each half oyster shell. For additional presentation value, serve them on a plate of crushed ice.
5.  Slice the lemons in half and serve on the side along with all remaining ingredients. The oysters can be enjoyed with any combination of the condiments; my personal favorite is a light squeeze of lemon juice, a pinch of salt and a dash of Tobasco sauce.
6.  Advise your guests to NOT chew the oysters, they are to be savored and swallowed whole.
