##### Steps to make Brad's shrimp and creamy polenta breakfast:

1.  Heat a large heavy bottomed pot. Add a touch of oil. Saute on medium low heat onion, jalapeño, and garlic until onions become translucent.
2.  Meanwhile, heat a LG non stick frying pan on medium heat. Add butter. When butter clarifies, add shrimp and Cajun spices. Saute 1 1/2 minutes. The butter will brown. Stir constantly. Add wine and lemon juice. Reduce liquid almost completely. Remove shrimp to a bowl and pour all of the pan sauce over the top. Wash pan to reuse.
3.  Once onion is sweated out, add water, milk, cajun spice, and chicken bouillon to the pot. Slowly bring to a boil.
4.  While this is happening, fry 2 eggs to your liking. I go Sunnyside up so the yolk soaks down onto the polenta.
5.  When pot is boiling slowly whisk in cornmeal. Stir constantly until polenta is soft and smooth without lumps.
6.  Plate polenta. Top with more cheese. Arrange shrimp around the outside. Top with eggs. Add hot sauce if desired. Serve immediately. Enjoy.
