2.  Open head and remove the entrails.
3.  Add water to boil with some salt and the bay leaf. You can use a large casserole pot.
4.  Plunge the whole octopus into the boiling water and remove immediately. This action makes it shrink and helps to make it soft. Repeat this action twice more and leave in the water.
5.  Leave it to boil for 30 minutes. Depends on the size of the octopus.
6.  Turn off the head and leave everything in the pot for 5 to 10 minutes. This prevents the meat from peeling.
