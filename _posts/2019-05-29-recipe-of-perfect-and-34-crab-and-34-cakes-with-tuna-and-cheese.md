##### Instructions to make "Crab" Cakes with Tuna and Cheese:

1.  Tomato sauce: Sauté the onions and garlic in olive oil. Then add the canned tomato, bay leaf, and consommé and simmer well. Season with salt and pepper.
2.  Crab cakes: Thoroughly knead the canned tuna, crab sticks, onions, panko, milk, eggs, and salt and pepper together.
3.  Tuck 1/2 the listed amount (about about 12 g each) of Camembert cheese in a patty of tuna-crabstick mix. Form into rounds and dust lightly with flour.
4.  Heat butter and vegetable oil in a pan, and pan-fry each patty from Step 3 one at a time until crisp on both sides.
5.  Arrange on a plate and top with some of the tomato sauce that's been reheated. Sprinkle on parsley, arrange some baby leaf lettuce on the side, and serve.

In separate bowl, blend panko crumbs with Parmesan cheese (more mixture may be needed for breading). The flaky, supple meat adds a delicately sweet richness to everything from soups and salads to dips and crostini. Of course, crab meat is arguably showcased at its best when formed into a classic crab cake. Crab has always been my favorite type of shellfish, but I have never really cared much for crab cakes. The overpowering presence of seasoned breadcrumbs used in most recipes interferes with the sweet and delicate flavors of the fresh lump crabmeat.
