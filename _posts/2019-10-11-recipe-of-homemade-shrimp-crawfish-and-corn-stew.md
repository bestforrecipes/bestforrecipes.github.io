6.  Add cooked/peeled/thawed crawfish and remaining whole corn kernels to pot, stir in.
7.  Now comes the fun!!! Season that thang up 2 ur liking w about a tablespoon of liquid crab boil or old bay… be VERY VERY careful on this step cuz that crap is super hot so take it slow…add it gradually until u get desired heat. Then add more salt/pepper or spice blend to taste.
8.  Stir everything together well one good time then cover w lid and let it simmer on low heat for about 15-20 mins.
