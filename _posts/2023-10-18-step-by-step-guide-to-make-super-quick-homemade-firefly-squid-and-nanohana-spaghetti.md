3.  Dissolve 8-10 g of salt in 1 liter of boiling water, and cook the spaghetti 2 minutes less than the time instructed on the package.
4.  Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, garlic, and red chili peppers into a cold frying pan, then heat the pan over low heat. Let the oil absorb the aromas.
5.  Remove the red chili peppers from the pan since they get burnt easily. When the garlic changes its colour, add the firefly squid, and briefly stir-fry. Add 2 tablespoons of white wine and evaporate the alcohol.
6.  Turn off the heat, and wait for the pasta to finish cooking. Cook the nanohana in the pot with the pasta. Cook the thick part of the nanohana for 30 seconds and the soft part for 10 seconds.
7.  Transfer the pasta and nanohana into the pan without draining the excess water, and gently mix for about 1 minute to let the pasta absorb the sauce.
