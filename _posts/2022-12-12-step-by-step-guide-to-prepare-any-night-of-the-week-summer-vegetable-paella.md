##### The ingredients needed to make Summer Vegetable Paella:

5.  Take Summer veg of your choice - peas, beans, asparagus
6.  Prepare Mushrooms - prefer chestnut in this but I used oyster
7.  Prepare Saffron or turmeric
8.  Get 1 Lemon
9.  Make ready 1 bunch parsley

##### Instructions to make Summer Vegetable Paella:

1.  Add a little oil and heat. I use a spray, you just need a little. Chop onion and 1 shallot (roast the other) and fry over a low heat. Add chopped peppers and stir, paprika and a little crushed tomato. Add saffron (I used a little grated turmeric root as I didn’t have any) and stir gently. Add the paella rice fry for 1 minute in the mixture. Add the quantity of water it suggests on the packet and bring to a simmer.

3.  Chop the veg that you wish to roast. Put a cross on the tomatoes, you will remove there skins and the will form part of the sauce. Keep the garlic in it’s skin, it will become soft.
4.  Remove the tomatoes skins, add and stir.
5.  Add the summer veg whist there is still a little liquid in the pan and the roasted veg just as the liquid is absorbed. Chop or add whole, as you prefer. Squeeze the roasted garlic onto the rice, I love garlic but add to your taste.
6.  To serve, add a good squeeze of lemon, chopped parsley and a few shakes of Tabasco. This is the secret ingredient and I think it’s delicious on paella. Enjoy in the garden with a cool drink 😀
