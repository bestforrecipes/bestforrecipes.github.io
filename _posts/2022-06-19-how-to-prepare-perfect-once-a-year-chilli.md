##### Steps to make Once a year chilli:

1.  Wash & soak your beans over night. (if u actually use dry beans)
2.  Dice veggies
3.  Place everything aside from meats into a large pot. (All seasonings, herbs, spices, liquids, & beans). This allows the stock/broth to soften up veggies, rice & beans a little & for all the flavors to marry somewhat.
4.  Fry up bacon in a separate pan. (Crispy) remove from pan. Use remaining oil to brown ground meat & sausages in.
5.  Once it’s browned, drain any access oil from meat. (Shouldn’t be much) Add all meats to pot with everything else. Use a blender to cut crispy bacon up & add to pot. If you don’t have blender, just cut it up.
6.  Add 3-4 cups of water to pot. High heat for about an hour. \*YOU MUST CONTINUE STARRING & MIXING DURING THIS HOUR SO THAT CHILLI DOESN’T BURN !!!
7.  Take away from heat & let sit for another hour. Once cooled somewhat, this will allow you to taste & add whatever you may feel you need more of. Turn heat to a simmer, & let it ride. Turning & starring here & there, insuring no burning or sticking is taking place. I simmer mines for nearly 4-5 hours. Once I’m sure it’s complete, add shrimp & continue simmer for another 10-20 mins. Bowl up & enjoy.
