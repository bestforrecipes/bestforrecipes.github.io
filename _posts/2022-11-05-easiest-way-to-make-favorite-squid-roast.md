##### Steps to make Squid Roast:

3.  In the same pot add 2 tbps coconut oil. Add curry leaves again along with chopped onion, green chilli. Cook this until the onion is pink.

7.  Give it a good mix and let the masala cook on a medium flame. After 5 minutes you will see oil separating from the masala which means it’s cooked properly.
8.  Add in the squid, coat it well with the masala, drizzle 2 tbps of coconut oil, close the lid and cook this for 10 minutes.
9.  Do not overcook since the squid can become rubbery. After 10 minutes switch off the flame and give another 10 minutes for the squid to absorb the flavor before serving
