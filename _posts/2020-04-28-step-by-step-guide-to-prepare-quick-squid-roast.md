##### Instructions to make Squid Roast:

1.  Marinate the squid with 1tbps red chilli powder, 1tbps turmeric powder, 1tbps ginger garlic paste and half teaspoon salt. Keep this aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes minimum.
2.  After 30 minutes heat 2 tbps coconut oil in an earthen pot. Yes use earthen or clay pot which I believe is perfect to cook this. Add 1 sprig curry leaves, let them splutter. Add the marinated squid and saute for couple of minutes and keep this aside
3.  In the same pot add 2 tbps coconut oil. Add curry leaves again along with chopped onion, green chilli. Cook this until the onion is pink.
4.  Add ginger garlic paste and saute till the raw smell disappears.
5.  Add chopped tomatoes now and cook until it’s mushy.
6.  Add 2 tbps water along with 1 tbps each of chilli powder, turmeric powder, paprika powder and garam masala powder so the masala doesn't burn
7.  Give it a good mix and let the masala cook on a medium flame. After 5 minutes you will see oil separating from the masala which means it’s cooked properly.
8.  Add in the squid, coat it well with the masala, drizzle 2 tbps of coconut oil, close the lid and cook this for 10 minutes.
9.  Do not overcook since the squid can become rubbery. After 10 minutes switch off the flame and give another 10 minutes for the squid to absorb the flavor before serving
10.  Serve this with steam rice
