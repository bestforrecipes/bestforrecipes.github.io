##### Steps to make Pink Salmon Fishcakes & Tartare Sauce:

1.  Mix together the mashed potato, fish, lemon zest, dried mint salt and pepper in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refridgerate.
2.  In a medium bowl, combine all the tartare sauce ingredients, cover that with plastic wrap and refridgerate.
3.  Prepare three dishes, one with the flour, one with the egg and one with the breadcrumbs in.
4.  Take the fishcake mixture out of the fridge, and get two plates ready to put the fishcakes onto
5.  Take handfuls of the mixture and form them into patties and place them on one of the plates. This recipe makes about ten fishcakes.
6.  Next, take one of the fishcakes, and with your left hand put it into the flour, get it coated and shake off any excess. Place it into the egg.
7.  Now, using your right hand, coat it in egg, then place it in the breadcrumbs, and cover it in them, picking some up from around it and placing them on top and rolling it gently until it's all coated.
8.  Place the fishcake on the other plate, then repeat the previous process until all the fishcakes are coated in crumbs. You may need to wipe the crumbs and egg off your right hand a couple of times.
9.  Heat up 3 tablespoons of sunflower oil in a large non stick skillet.
10.  Cook half the fishcakes (you will mist likely need to do them in two batches) for 3-4 minutes each side on a medium low heat (breadcrumbs burn easily)
11.  Cook the second batch (you can keep the first batch warm in a low oven while you do this)
12.  Serve two fishcakes per adult (one is probably enough for a child) with peas and some tartare sauce on the side. Lemon slices optional. Kids will probably prefer ketchup to tartare sauce ;)
