6.  Take 1/4 cup chopped cilantro + more for garnish
7.  Make ready 1 packet Goya Sazón (Any kind - culantro, achiote, azafrán, etc. - will work fine in this dish.)

9.  Get 1 cup tomato sauce

11.  Prepare 1-2 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice

##### Instructions to make Spicy Latin-Inspired Shrimp in Tomato Sauce:

1.  In a large pan (at least 12") preheat the oil and butter on medium heat until all the butter is melted.
2.  Add onions, peppers, garlic, and cilantro, and sweat until onions are translucent.
