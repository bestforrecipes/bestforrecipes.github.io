4.  Rinse or just clean the mushrooms. some people like to wipe them but I rinse clean
5.  Pre heat oven to 350
6.  Heat a frying pan with butter pepper old bay and garlic. eyeball it. don't add to much spice unless you want these spicy as you will be adding additional spice later
7.  Put the mushroom caps in the frying pan. saute them for about 10 to 20 minutes. turning them over a few times. you want some of the flavors to get into the mushrooms. you can cook longer or shorter if you like

11.  Scoop crab mix into each mushroom cap. I usually add in the left over butter and garlic from the frying pan, but I didn't have much left so I added butter. You can use something else instead of butter.
12.  Get a casserole dish or a tin pan.
13.  Add the reserved liquid to the bottom of the pan. place mushrooms on top of liquid.
14.  Sprinkle old bay on top. bake covered for 15 to 25 minutes
