Avocado Sushi is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It is appreciated by millions daily. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. Avocado Sushi is something which I have loved my whole life. They’re nice and they look fantastic.

To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook avocado sushi using 5 ingredients and 12 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Avocado Sushi:

1.  Make ready 1 cup sushi rice
2.  Make ready 1.5 cup water
3.  Prepare 1 avocado skin removed, and cut into strips
4.  Make ready 3 tbsp sushi seasoning (Rice wine vinegar, sugar and salt)
5.  Get 3 Nori sheet Cut into halve

##### Instructions to make Avocado Sushi:

1.  Take sushi rice. It is a short-grained rice. Put rice and water in a pot on high heat. Let the water boil.
2.  Once the water starts to boil, lower the heat, stir the rice, cover the pot with lid and cook the rice for 20 minutes on low heat. Do not open the lid in between. After 20 minutes, the water will be absorbed and rice is cooked. Fluff the rice with a fork.
3.  Remove the rice in a wide dish. Add 3 tbsp of sushi seasoning to it and mix well. (I have used store brought obento brand Sushi seasoning. It is a mix of rice vinegar, salt and sugar). The vinegared rice is ready. Keep aside the rice to cool. (The rice should be cooled before making sushi).
4.  Now take the nori sheet and cut into half.
5.  This is the shiny glazed side of nori sheet.
6.  Place the nori sheet with the glaze side facing down on one edge of the bamboo mat as shown. (this mat is specially made to roll sushi). Take one cup of water and put 1 tbsp of sushi seasoning in it. Dip your palms in it. This will help to prevent rice from sticking in the hands.
7.  Now put a fistful of rice on the cut nori sheet. Spread it evenly on the sheet. Leave around 2 cm space on the top of the nori sheet as shown. Place the choice of your topping on it as shown. I have used Avocado strips. (You can use lengthwise cut cucumber, tofu, carrot).
8.  Now lift the end of the mat closest to you and begin to roll the sheet tightly. It should come at the end of the other end of the nori sheet leaving the 2 cm gap as shown. Press the roll tightly so that the edge of the nori sheet is tight.
9.  Open the mat roll the remaining roll. And roll and join the other end of the nori sheet. (You can also brush the other end of the nori sheet with water to help it sticking better to the roll).Now again with the help of the mat press the roll tightly so that it is nicely stuck and becomes a tight roll.
10.  Now cut the uneven end of the roll and cut into half with a sharp knife dipped in the water sushi seasoning solution. This helps to prevent knife sticking to the the sushi while cutting into pieces.
11.  Cut each halves into 3-4 small pieces.
12.  Arrange the cut sushi pieces into a plate and serve with the dipping sauce.
