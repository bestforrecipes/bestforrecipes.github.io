##### Instructions to make Hina Doll Prince and Princess Shaped Temari-zushi (round sushi balls):

1.  Cook 5 rice cooker cups of rice with the 'sushi rice' water level, and make sushi rice. 130 g sugar, 125 g rice vinegar, 10 g salt is my recipe for the sushi vinegar - we like it on the sweet side.
2.  Make the face parts. Cut the nori seaweed with kitchen scissors. Use the rounded part of a heart shaped piece of ham.

5.  Prepare the sakura denbu and salmon flakes. If you want to use other ingredients, make them ready also.
6.  Spread out a piece of plastic wrap and arrange the face directly on the plastic wrap. When making the princess, place a carrot flower on her head, and when making the prince, place a piece of broccolini on his head. Place the hair parts afterwards.
7.  If you place the nori eyes, ham mouth, and sakura denbu cheeks towards the center of the rice ball, it will look very cute.
8.  Gently top with sushi rice, add the filling and then very gently add a bit more sushi rice.
9.  Lift up the 4 corners of the plastic wrap and form it into a ball.
