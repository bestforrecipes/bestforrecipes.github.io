##### Instructions to make Mike's Spicy Thai Shrimp Ramen Noodles:

1.  Slice, chop and seperate your more dense vegetables from your softer vegetables. - - Authors Note: Some vegetables listed above aren't pictured below. I have a few picky eaters here tonight.
2.  Bring your broth, Chinese 5 Spice and sliced green onions a boil. - - Authors Note: Go low sodium on your broth. Remember, you can always add more soy sauce \[sodium\] but it's darn near impossible to remove it.
3.  Use regular Ramen Noodles or organic Ramen Noodles. Maruchan Noodles are easier due to their flavor packets. Either way, they're sturdy noodles that will hold up, even upon re-heating.
4.  Add your noodles to the boiling pot. Boil for exactly 3 minutes.
5.  Drain your noodles but don't disgard your broth. Reserve it just in case some want a wet noodle soup. Feel free to add additional water if need be.
6.  Place your boiled noodles and flavor packets with green onions in a bowl. Add 1/4 cup broth, as well as your Fish, Sriracha, Soy and Hoisin sauces. Mix well with chopsticks and seal noodles up tightly. - - Allow your noodles to sweat and plump up in all of that delicious flavor for at least 10 minutes.
7.  Seal tightly.
8.  Add sesame and wok oil to a heated pan or Wok.
9.  Add your most dense vegetables \[i.e., snap peas, water chestnuts, red/white onions, diakon radishes, carrots, jalapeños, etc.\] to your heated pan. Fry vegetables on high for 3 minutes. Stir regularly.
10.  Add your least dense vegetables \[i.e., cabbage, mushrooms, basil, cilantro and sprouts\] to your pan and fry for 1 minute longer. You'll want some crisp to your cabbage so don't over fry.
11.  Add your pre-steamed shrimp and noodle mixture to your sizzling Wok. Mix well and fry for 1 minute longer covered. Add additional broth if needed or desired.
12.  2 lbs pre-steamed, pre-shucked, de-veined shrimp.
13.  Know you can make this noodle dish on the dry or wet noodle side. \[as in a soup\] 1st picture below is a wet noodle soup. The bottom 2 pictures are considered dry, pan seared noodles. - - Serve noodles hot with sides of additional Soy, Siracha, Hoisin and Fish Sauce. Also, lime wedges and fresh Thai Basil. - - Garnish noodle dish with sesame seeds and fresh cilantro. Enjoy!
