##### Steps to make Shrimp and sausage smash potatoes:

1.  Scrub, wash, and clean potatoes, and cut in smaller cubes.
2.  I boil my potatoes in seasoned water. While they are cooking, cut and dice the veggies, and sausages. I also add some seasonings to the cut up veggies and sausages in a bowl, and toss around to coat in seasonings.
3.  Boil potatoes until pretty soft(So they can be partly smashed later). Drain.
4.  Have pan ready,with butter. Saute veggies, remove, saute sausages until brown on each side.
5.  Add rotel, garlic, let it boil, add shrimp & cooked veggies back in & anymore seasonings. turn down to low simmer until shrimp is heated.
6.  Remember, i used precooked/steamed in old bay from kroger, so mine only needed to be re-heated from where i had put in fridge earlier that day.
7.  Add mixture over semi smashed potatoes on plate.
8.  If u like more firm cooked potatoes, you can do that too. I just like mine softer with a little smash and with some bigger pieces of potatoes too.
9.  Also, If you like crunchier veggies, or have uncooked shrimp that hasnt been predone, you can just not saute veggies, and add it with the uncooked shrimp into the rotel, and it will cook it all. Plus, the sausages too. Since they dont take long to cook either. It's all in your preference. But i do recommend buying the fresh precooked shrimp in old bay from kroger or grocery market.
