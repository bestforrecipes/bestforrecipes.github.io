##### Instructions to make Autumnal Doria with Salmon and Mushrooms:

1.  Pre-heat the oven to 390°F/200°C. Skin the salmon fillet, sprinkle salt lightly on both sides and let it sit while you make the sauce.
2.  Melt the butter in a sauce pan and add the flour. You don't need to sift. Whisk with a balloon whisk, and after the flour is mixed well, add milk.
3.  After whisking for a while, the sauce will thicken a little. Continue to whisk, ensuring that the bottom of the pan doesn't get burned. Turn off the heat after the sauce thickens to your liking.
4.  Pat the salmon dry with a paper towel and cut it into bite-size pieces (removing bones that you find). Slice the onion and cut the mushrooms.
5.  Heat oil in a pan, fry the onion, then add the mushrooms and continue frying. When the onions are translucent and the mushrooms are cooked through, push the mixture to one side of the pan. Place the salmon in the pan and fry both sides. Do not mix the salmon with the mushrooms and onions.
6.  Take out the salmon and set it aside. Add the fried onion and mushrooms to the béchamel sauce and mix well.
7.  Fill oven-safe dishes about halfway with rice, then pour the béchamel sauce over the rice. Place the salmon on top.
8.  Scatter shredded cheese over the salmon, then sprinkle with cheese powder, panko and parsley as desired.
