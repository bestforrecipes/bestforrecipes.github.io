To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have mushroom marscapone phyllo bites using 13 ingredients and 15 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Mushroom Marscapone Phyllo Bites:

1.  Make ready 20 phyllo small pastry shells (already prepared to be filled)
2.  Get cheese Marscapone
3.  Take 5 to 6 shiitake mushrooms full
4.  Make ready 1 shallot
5.  Make ready 1 head garlic of
6.  Make ready Sherry
7.  Take Balsamic vinegar
8.  Get Salt / Pepper
9.  Get Parsley
10.  Get Swiss cheese (optional)
11.  Make ready Olive oil
12.  Take Butter
13.  Take Honey

##### Steps to make Mushroom Marscapone Phyllo Bites:

1.  Rinse and roughly chop shiitakes and place to the side
2.  Mince 1 shallot
3.  Separate each clove from the head of garlic (skin still on)
4.  On a piece of aluminum foil, toss the cut shallot and garlic cloves together with 1 1/2 to 2 tbsp. of olive oil and 1 tsp. of honey
5.  Cup the aluminum foil 1/2 way over the mixture and place in the oven on broil for 10 minutes or so. This ensures a crispy roasting time but depending on the temperature of your oven it could be more or less time
6.  In the meantime, take out your phyllo pastry shells and 1 tbsp. of butter. Once the butter is semi-soft, either use hands or a utensil to lightly coat the phyllo with a glistening light layer of butter. Lay the shells about a 1/4 inch apart on a baking sheet. Take out the marscapone from the fridge so it will be softer to spread!
7.  After the mixture is roasted and caramelized, allow the shallots to cool a bit while shucking the garlic! The garlic cloves will be warm so it will be simple to pop the garlic out (removing it's skin)
8.  Finely mince the garlic. In a bowl, gently combine the garlic, the shallots, and the shiitakes
9.  Add a pinch of salt and parsley to the mixture. Use a bit of black pepper (if your prefer). Stir in about 3 splashes of sherry and 1 splash of balsamic vinegar. Once tossed, place the mixture aside
10.  Taking care of the phyllo cups, use a spoon to gently glide a layer of marscapone on the bottom of each pastry. I only had to use about 1 tsp. (depending on the size of your pastry). The phyllo is delicate, so gentle is the key!
11.  Sprinkle a decent amount of parsley over the layer of marscapone
12.  Now is the time to add the filling! Scoop about a tbsps amount of the mixture into each cup, pressing down slightly towards the bottom. Keep piling the filling on top until each is completely filled.
13.  Set your oven to 350 degrees and let cook for 20 - 30 minutes. If preferred, swiss cheese on top 1/2 throughout cooking time (it's even more yummy)!
14.  Remove from oven and let stand for 5 - 10 minutes
15.  Voila !
