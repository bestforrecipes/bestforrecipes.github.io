3.  Use the point of your knife to separate the foot of the oyster from its shell on both sides. Use your hands to open the shell completely; discard the more shallow half of the shell.
4.  Rinse the meat and retained shell to rid them of any shell fragments and/or sand. Serve the meat on top of each half oyster shell. For additional presentation value, serve them on a plate of crushed ice.
