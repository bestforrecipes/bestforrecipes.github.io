Tomato and tofu egg is a really simple dish to make…it's humble, homey, but every bit mouthwatering and delicious. It's one of those dishes that epitomizes the greatness of home cooking. Egg Tofu is Japanese steamed tofu made of eggs and dashi mixture that is steamed till firm, chilled, then served with a dashi and soy sauce broth. Even though it's called "tofu", egg tofu does not include soybeans or nigari.

##### Steps to make Easy Giseidofu with Tofu and Egg:

1.  Absorb the excess water from the tofu with paper towels. Julienne the vegetables.
2.  Blanch the prepared vegetables (about for 1 minute). You don't need to blanch the frozen edamame beans or pre-cooked edamame beans. If you use prawns, cook quickly in the same water after blanching the vegetables.
3.  Save some vegetables for garnish.
4.  Mash the tofu until smooth and stir in the egg yolk (you can add 1 tablespoon of mentsuyu, not listed in the ingredients).
5.  Add the vegetables from Step 2 to the tofu mixture. I used prawns, carrot, and edamame beans in the photo. Add small shavings of yuzu to enhance the flavour of the mixture.
6.  Line round-bottomed dishes with cling film. Ladle 1/3 of the mixture from Step 5 into each dish. Pull the sides of the cling film toward the top and twist to seal. Lay the twisted part over the top of the mixture.
7.  Microwave each dish for 2 minutes. After microwaving, upturn the dishes onto your serving dishes. Do this after they have cooled, since they will be very hot.
8.  Put one ladle of dashi stock (or water + dashi powder) and 2 tablespoons of mentsuyu together and bring to the boil. Add the katakuriko to thicken.
9.  Pour an sauce over the tofu dish and garnish with the vegetables you set aside and the yuzu shavings. Yuzu will give a great flavour to the dish, so I suggest you use it if you have some!!
10.  To store yuzu, wrap it up in a double layers of cling film and freeze. You can shave or grate the rind anytime you need it for cooking or for garnish in your clear broth.
