##### Steps to make Mike's EZ Pappadeaux Grilled Oysters:

1.  Heat your grill to high heat.
2.  Drain your spinach well. Place in cheese cloth or clean paper towels and squeeze all fluids out hard. Then, shread spinach fine. Know that fresh spinach will not work well in this appetizer. It's far too moist.
3.  Make your Knorrs Hollandaise Sauce in a pot on the stove with a whisk. This one packet will usually require 1 cup milk and 1/4 cup quality butter. In my opinion, Knorrs is the best pre-fabed Hollandaise Sauce out there.
4.  In this order: Add a generous amount of crab meat on top of your fresh oysters. Then, add fresh finely minced garlic, fresh, finely grated parmesean cheese, black pepper, shreadded spinach and a slight drizzle of Hollandaise Sauce to your oysters on the half shell. Don't overload them but pack each of those oversized shells well!.
5.  Place oysters on grill and grill for 5 minutes on high heat covered. No peeking! Just trust them! ;0)
6.  Pull oysters from grill quickly and garnish with fresh green chives and fresh parsley. Serve immediately with sides of chilled or charred lemon wedges and Tabasco. Enjoy!
7.  You can also serve your oysters raw on the half shell and dress them with hot sauce, cocktail sauce, lemon wedges or horseradish sauce. Garnish plate with fresh parsley.

I love oysters any way you can fix them. I will eat oysters straight out. Arrange oysters in a single layer on grill.
