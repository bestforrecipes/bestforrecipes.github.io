3.  Now, cook the pasta until 2 minutes before it's ready, meanwhile, add the plum tomatoes to the sauce, stir till well mixed.
4.  To the sauce, add the seafood, the lemon zest, paprika, the cayenne pepper and another pinch of salt.
5.  Drain the pasta, leaving around a cup of water in. Pour it into the sauce and stir it.
6.  Add the lemon juice and the chopped coriander. Mix it all well. If you like, you can sprinkle some parmesan shavings on top when served. Try it and adjust the salt if necessary. Enjoy!
