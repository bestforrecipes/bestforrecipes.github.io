##### Steps to make Black handkerchief pasta with cuttlefish, mussels, prawn and chilli:

1.  Black Pasta Dough:
2.  Make a well in the middle of the flour, add salt and in a separate bowl add squid ink to eggs and whisk. Add egg mix to flour and begin to combine working from the outer edge to the middle until dough has formed. Knead for 5 minutes then cover and rest for 20 minutes.
3.  After dough has rested set your pasta machine to the thickest setting and begin putting your dough through, gradually lowering the settings to achieve a thin sheet of pasta. - (You may need to dust with flour every 2nd or 3rd roll though to help the sheet not to stick.) - When you have a very thin sheet of pasta, cut the sheets 8cm by 8cm and in portion groups of 8 squares per person. Set aside.
4.  The Sauce:
5.  Clean the cuttlefish by removing the hard cuttlebone found inside the body along with any other organs. Trim the tentacles and chop, set aside. Remove the skin from the cuttlefish and slice thinly then add to tentacles.
6.  Remove the shells from the prawns, de-vein and chop, set aside.
7.  In a heavy base pot heat the cottonseed oil and add the 2 cloves of crushed garlic then add the chopped celery, carrot, onion and thyme, add the wine and cook for 3 mins then add mussels, cover and steam for 3-4 mins or until mussels have opened.
8.  Remove from the heat and take the mussels out, strain liquid and reserve for later. Remove mussel meat from the shell, chop and set aside.
9.  To Assemble:
10.  Bring a large pot of water to the boil.
11.  Warm a pan and add the extra virgin oil, do not heat to smoking point. Lightly poach cuttlefish and prawns in oil then quickly add garlic and chilli, cook for a further minute and remove seafood and oil to awaiting bowl. Return pan to heat and turn up gas, add about 80ml of mussel stock and begin to put pasta in the boiling water one at a time stirring when you finish.
12.  Cook pasta for one minute then remove and add to the pan, (you may need to add a little of the pasta water if your stock has reduced to far) add seafood and oil mix and begin to emulsify the oil and stock by tossing the pasta in the pan, check your seasoning and finish with chopped chervil, plate and serve.
