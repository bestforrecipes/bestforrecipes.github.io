##### Instructions to make Turkish seafood soup ♪:

1.  Chop all vegetables. Souse aubergine in water for a while. Crush a garlic (or minced is ok too)
2.  Rinse the fish with fresh water. Make sure to scale if they have. Rinse the prawns, pull of legs, shells, remove the vein from the prawn. I kept tails. It's better to keep the shells also as they become a great broth.(it's up to you.)
3.  Heat olive oil in a deep pan or pot, add fish starting on skin side. Turn it when the skin becomes crispy. And leave them on a side.
4.  Add olive oil and garlic with low heat. Leave it till it become golden color.
5.  Add onion, carrot to #4. Fry till they are softened, add aubergine, tomato and fry well for 10mins. Then add tomato cans, and water (600cc〜), chicken broth (or vegetable stock), bay leave (optional).
6.  Simmer for 10 mins and add fish. Simmer for another 20 mins or so with low heat. (I prefer longer)
7.  Add prawns to #6. It's better not to cook prawns for long time as it gets hard. Add salt, pepper, mint.
8.  Serve in bowls topped with a yogurt.
