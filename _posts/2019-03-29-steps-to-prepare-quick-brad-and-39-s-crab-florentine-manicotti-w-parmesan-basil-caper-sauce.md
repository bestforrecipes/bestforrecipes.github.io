##### Steps to make Brad's crab florentine manicotti w/ parmesan, basil, caper sauce:

1.  Boil 6 qts water in a large pot. Salt to taste. Add manicotti noodles and boil 6 minutes. Strain in a colander and rinse with cold water. They will seem too al dente, but they will soften in 15 to 20 minutes. This is how you dont overcook the noodles and they will hold together better when stuffing them.
2.  While this is cooking mix the rest of the manicotti ingredients in a large mixing bowl.
3.  Heat a large frying pan on medium heat. Add oil. Saute onions until they just start to brown. Add garlic and capers. Make sure to get a little caper brine in there too. Saute another 2 minutes.
4.  Add cream, basil, and bouillon. Slowly bring to a simmer.
5.  Meanwhile, stuff noodles with the filling. I used a butter knife. It seems to be a bit easier on the noodles.
6.  Grease a 9x13 baking dish. Arrange stuffed noodles in it.
7.  When sauce starts to simmer, slowly add mozzarella until sauce thickens a bit.
8.  Pour sauce over noodles and top with remaining cheeses. Bake in a 375 degree oven for 10 minutes on the middle rack.
9.  Change your oven over to high broiler. All broilers are different, so keep an eye on it. I went another 10 minutes. You want the cheese to just start browning on top.
10.  Remove from oven and let stand 5 minutes. Serve with fresh basil leaves for garnish. Enjoy.
