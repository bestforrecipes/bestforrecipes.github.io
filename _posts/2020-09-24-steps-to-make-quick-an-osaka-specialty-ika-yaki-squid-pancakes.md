##### The ingredients needed to make An Osaka Specialty: Ika-yaki (Squid Pancakes):

1.  Get 100 grams - 180 grams Squid
2.  Get 140 grams Cake flour
3.  Make ready 10 grams Bread (strong) flour
4.  Make ready 5 grams Katakuriko
5.  Make ready 1 tsp Dashi stock granules
6.  Prepare 200 grams Water
7.  Take 1 Vegetable oil
8.  Take 1 Okonomiyaki sauce and takoyaki sauce

##### Instructions to make An Osaka Specialty: Ika-yaki (Squid Pancakes):

1.  Slice the body of the prepped squid into rounds, then cut into 1cm dice.
2.  Combine the flours, dashi stock granules, and water, and mix until it's slightly sticky (meaning the gluten in the flour has formed).
3.  Add the squid to the batter, and leave for at least 30 minutes. If the batter becomes too firm, add a little water so that it's the consistency of crepe batter.
4.  Add oil in a pan, and pour in the batter (You can add an egg here to upgrade the pancake to a deluxe version.)
5.  When one side is browned, turn the pancake over. Cook the other side while pressing down hard on the pancake with your spatula.
6.  When the pancake is cooked, spread the combined okonomiyaki and takoyaki sauces, fold in half and press.
7.  If you add too much squid, the pancakes will be hard to cook. I'm not too good at cooking these myself. If you're not used to making pancakes, try cooking one with just a little squid added to the batter.
