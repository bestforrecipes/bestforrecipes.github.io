The extensive menu features sashimi, sushi, handrolls, grilled dishes, deep-fried dishes, noodles, and rice options. I'm a fan of their sashimi, which are freshly prepared upon order and sliced to a thick succulent piece. Those are only two of many very different forms or formats that sushi can take. Some other \[American\] places are serving chirashi or bara (verbs that mean to scatter, impression of random scattering, but bara is more random in connotation) or doing inarizushi, fried tofu.
