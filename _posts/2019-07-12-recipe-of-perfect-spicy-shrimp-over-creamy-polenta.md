Upgrade your weeknight dinner with this easy Spicy Shrimp with Creamy Polenta recipe. Serve shrimp over polenta and garnish with remaining green onion greens. In this dish for Creamy Polenta with Spicy Shrimp, I kick up the polenta a notch by melting in a handful cheese then topping it with sauteed onions, a simple fresh tomato sauce, and spicy shrimp. The great part about making this meal, is that while the polenta is simmering.

##### Instructions to make Spicy shrimp over creamy polenta:

1.  Prep all you ingredients first. Chop all the vegetables, peel and clean your shrimp, blend the spices together. Season the shrimp with about half of the spice mixture.
2.  Heat skillet over medium high heat and add 2 tablespoons oil. Once hot add the shrimp and sear for 1-2 minutes on each side and remove from pan (they will finish cooking when you add them to the sauce later.) Next reduce heat to medium and add the onion, celery, and jalapenos to the same pan. Use a little more oil to saute if needed. With a wooden spatula scrape the pan to get any brown bits mixed in. When this starts to soften add the garlic and cook for a minute then stir in tomato paste.
3.  Once the tomato paste has been mixed in well add the tomatoes, green peppers, and the rest of the spice mixture. Give that a stir and add the chicken broth. If it seems to thick you can add more liquid.
4.  Let this cook over medium high heat for about 5 minutes. Just until the peppers are soft but still have a bite to them. Turn heat off and add the shrimp in. Give a good stir and your ready to serve. Garnish with fresh herbs.

Place a large skillet over medium high heat and add shrimp to the skillet. Cook until the shrimp turn pale white and remove from heat.

She couldn't stop bubbling over with gratefulness for her surgeons, her community who sent her.
