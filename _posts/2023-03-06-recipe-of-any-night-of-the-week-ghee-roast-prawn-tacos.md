Here is how to do prawn ghee roast. First we will grind the masala. Take all the masala ingredients in a mixie and grind it to a smooth paste. No need to add water while grinding.

##### Instructions to make Ghee Roast Prawn Tacos:

1.  For making the ghee roast prawns remove the shells from the prawns, clean them and marinate them with the curd, turmeric powder, salt and lemon juice for about 15 minutes
2.  In the mean time soak the red chillies into some hot water
3.  Now let's prepare a roasted spice powder. For that, dry roast the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, whole black pepper, mustard seeds & fenugreek seeds together in a pan and then grind them into a fine powder
4.  Now remove the red chillies from the soaking water & grind them along with the roasted spice powder into a paste. Add some water during grinding to make sure all the spices are blended well
5.  Now mix the kashmiri red chilli powder into this paste & blend everything one more time
6.  Now take this spice blend into a bowl & mix the garlic paste into it. Keep it aside
7.  Now heat the ghee into a pan & add the marinated prawns into it
8.  Cook for few minutes & when a good amount of liquid comes out of the prawns remove the prawns from the pan. Then cook the leftover liquid for about 3-4 minutes
9.  Now add add the prepared spice blend into the pan & cook for another 2-3 minutes
10.  Now add the salt & tamarind pulp and cook for few more minutes
11.  Now add the prawns back into the pan & cook until the prawns are almost coated with all the spices
12.  Then add the sugar & curry leaves and saute for another 2-3 minutes. Ghee roast prawns are ready. Turn off the flame
13.  Now it's time to prepare the taco shells. For that, take the maize flour & the all purpose flour together in a large utensil and add the vegetable oil & the salt into it. Mix everything very well
14.  Now pour some lukewarm water little at a time into the flour mixture and knead well until you come up with a medium soft dough
15.  Now make few small balls out of the dough, dust each ball with some flour & roll it out into a thin disc
16.  Now take a round cookie cutter or a small circular lid of a bottle & press it at the middle of the disc in order to get a smooth circle that resembles a 'puri'. Remove the extra edges from the 'puri' but don't throw them. These leftover pieces can be used to make more taco shells in the similar manner
17.  Now prick the 'puri' with a fork so that it doesn't puff up during frying. Prepare all the 'puri's in the similar manner
18.  Now heat sufficient oil into a pan & throw one taco 'puri' at a time into the oil. Fry each side of the 'puri' for about 30 seconds
19.  Then take a tong or you can follow the procedure that I used. Take a fork & a spoon and hold them together like a tong. Use this procedure to hold the 'puri' into a half moon shaped structure
20.  Fry the half moon shaped taco shell until it is golden brown. Then remove it from the oil & prepare all the taco shells in the similar manner
21.  Now it's time to prepare the coconut chutney. For that, I have already soaked the chana dal into some hot water for an hour. Now it's time to drain the water from the dal
22.  Now grind the coconut, curry leaves, chana dal and the coriander leaves along with some water into a fine paste. Add the salt into the mixture & the chutney is ready
23.  To prepare the salad mix the chopped cucumber, tomato & coriander leaves together into a bowl and add the lemon juice & the black pepper powder into it
24.  Now add the salt. Mix everything well & the salad is ready
25.  To marinate the onion rings add the chat masala & the red chilli powder into the rings and mix everything well
26.  Now let's assemble the tacos. Take one taco shell at a time, put some salad inside. Then put some ghee roast prawns on top of the salad layer
27.  Now insert some marinated onion rings at one side of the prawns & drizzle some coconut chutney on top
28.  Assemble all the tacos in the similar manner & now they are ready to serve
