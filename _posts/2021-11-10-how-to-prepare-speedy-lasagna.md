**Lasagna**

Hey everyone, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, lasagna. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Lasagna is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It is simple, it’s fast, it tastes yummy. It’s enjoyed by millions daily. They are nice and they look wonderful. Lasagna is something which I have loved my whole life.

Lasagne are a type of wide, flat pasta, possibly one of the oldest types of pasta. Lasagne, or the singular lasagna, is an Italian dish made of stacked layers of thin flat pasta alternating with fillings. The ultimate comfort food lasagna, with layers of rich homemade meat sauce, creamy béchamel sauce , noodles , cheese and fresh mozzarella.

To begin with this recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook lasagna using 7 ingredients and 12 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Lasagna:

1.  Take 12 Lasagna Noodles
2.  Take Sauce from my Foodi Hearty Pasta Sauce Recipe
3.  Get Filling from my recipe Filling for Lasagna or Stuffed Shells
4.  Take 1 lb block of Whole Milk Mozzarella (grated)
5.  Take Grated Parmesan Cheese
6.  Get Fennel Seed
7.  Prepare Chopped Parsley for garnish

This white lasagna involves the clever hack of using egg roll wrappers instead of noodles (which means no boiling). From Italian lasagna (and its plural lasagne), possibly from Vulgar Latin \*lasania, from Latin lasanum ("cooking pot"), from Ancient Greek λάσανον (lásanon, "trivet or stand for a pot"). Others argue the Italian lasagna originally derived from the Arabic لَوْزِينَج‎ (lawzīnaj, "almond cake"). A sorta of farewell used when "Goodbye" isn't enough. "See you tomorrow, dude!" I ate her lasagna for hours.

##### Instructions to make Lasagna:

1.  Preheat oven to 350°. Grease a 13x9 pan including on the sides. Boil water in a large stock pot.
2.  Boil lasagna noodles according to package (typically 9 minutes). Drain and immediately run cold water over them.
3.  I like to lay my noodles out on parchment paper to ensure they stay flat as I'm working.
4.  Spread thin layer of sauce (approximately one ladle full) on bottom of pan.
5.  Arrange 4 noodles in pan, slightly overlapping, to start first layer.
6.  Add 1/2 Filling for Lasagna (available in my recipes). I use a melon baller to scoop it into a grid of 12 (3x4) and then spread evenly out with the back of a spoon. Just makes for easy quick and even distribution.
7.  Sprinkle grated mozzarella, grated parmesan, and fennel seeds over filling mixture.
8.  Use approximately 1.5-2 ladles of sauce to cover 1st layer. Spread evenly with back of spoon.
9.  Repeat assembly for 2nd layer. (4 noodles, other half of ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, fennel seed, sauce)
10.  Last layer, add final 4 noodles, cover with sauce, generously cover with mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley.
11.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake 45 minutes. Remove foil. Increase oven temp to 400°. Bake 15 minutes more. Remove and let cool 45 minutes to set.
12.  (optional): I usually double the recipe, assembling two. I put one in the oven. The other, I add the foil, then wrap the entire pan over and under well with saran wrap, and freeze it. I remove to refrigerator the day before I want to bake it, discard the saran wrap, and bake it the same as above.

Gladly, there was no cottage or ricotta cheese to speak of. Lasagna Bolognese is a typical dish of Emilia Romagna, in particular of the city of Bologna. In Italy Lasagna Bolognese is a typical Sunday lunch dish or the main course for festivities and anniversaries. Classic Lasagna is great for feeding a crowd, and also freezes well for new mom meals and quick thaw dinners. I've been making lasagna for a long time, and there are quite a few variables to play with.
