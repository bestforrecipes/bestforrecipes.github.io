##### Instructions to make Moist and Spicy Squid Kimchi Tossed With Gochugang:

1.  Soak the squid in water for 1 to 2 minutes to remove some of the saltiness. This will make the flavors in the sauce blend, and soften the overall taste.
2.  In a bowl, combine all the seasoning ingredients, except for the sesame oil. Add more chili powder, garlic, and/or sugar to taste.
3.  Squeeze out the water, and blot the squid completely dry before mixing it into the sauce.
4.  Work the seasoning into the squid with your hands. A disposable plastic glove works well for this step.
5.  Add the sesame oil last. It's fine to eat right away, but best the following day.
