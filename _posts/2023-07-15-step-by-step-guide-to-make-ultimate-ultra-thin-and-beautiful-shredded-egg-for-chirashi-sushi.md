##### Instructions to make Ultra-Thin and Beautiful Shredded Egg for Chirashi Sushi:

1.  Add the salt to the eggs. The ratio is 1/4 teaspoon salt for 2 eggs.
2.  Beat the eggs well without creating foam. If you don't thoroughly beat the eggs, they won't become a nice yellow color. The point is to beat them completely.
3.  Strain through a fine mesh sieve.
4.  Before cooking the egg, prepare a large sieve turned upside down for later use. The cooked egg will be placed over the sieve so that the surface can dry out.
5.  Add a large amount of vegetable oil to a frying pan. Spread it around with a paper towel. Use this paper towel to wipe the oil onto the frying pan after cooking the first batch of the egg.
6.  If the frying pan becomes too hot, the egg won't cook nicely, so place it on a damp cloth to cool it down.
7.  Pour a liberal amount of the egg mixture into the frying pan. After the surface of the egg has cooked, quickly return any excess egg to the egg mixture bowl. If you do this, the thickness will be uniform and you can make a nice thin shredded egg.
8.  Turn the egg over using long chopsticks and cook the other side. If you take too long to do this, it will burn, so it's best to remove it from the heat during this step.
9.  Once cooked, place it on top of the prepared upside down sieve, so that it can dry while the next batch of egg is being cooked. 5 eggs will make about 5-6 batches.
10.  Stack all of the cooked egg omelets on top of one another. Trim off the edges. You don't have to trim the edges, but it will make it look a lot tidier.
