This time around, the robust flavor of the garlic olive oil paired with the salmon and brussels sprouts proved to be as amazing as you can imagine. The Brussels sprouts come out charred and crunchy, exactly how I love them in my oven after roasting.

##### Instructions to make Charred salmon and sprouts:

1.  Set the oven to 200 degrees C. Put sprouts on a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and put in the oven.
2.  After about 5 minutes, put the rice into a large pan of salted, boiling water and simmer.
3.  Drizzle honey over the salmon. Pour on some olive oil on and season with salt and pepper. Leave in the packet for now. Heat some olive oil in a frying pan.
4.  Start the sauce. Heat the onions in a pan over a medium heat. When they start to soften add the garlic. About a minute later add all of the wine and vinegar. Turn up the heat a bit so the liquid bubbles.
5.  While the wine reduces, start frying the salmon skin-side down. The pan should be hot. When the skin crisps up, turn the salmon over and remove the skin (it should just peel off). The honey will start to caramelise. Turn the heat down a bit. Chop up the salmon into large chunks and continue frying until they’re charred and cooked through.
6.  While salmon chunks are frying, add the stock to the sauce. After a few minutes add the butter and stir while the liquid continues to reduce and the butter thickens it up. When the sauce has a nice velvety texture, take off the heat and season to taste.
7.  The rice, sprouts, salmon and sauce should all be ready at roughly the same time. When the sprouts are a bit charred they’ll be just cooked through. Serve however you like - perhaps in a big heap like mine.

There may be some smoke, but what is important is that the salmon is well charred so it has a bitter, crisp bottom and the flesh is sweet, soft and Serve the salad on plates, then carefully lift the salmon from the pan and sit it on top, skin-side up. Drizzle with a little more extra virgin olive oil and tuck in. Mike found a pepper that leveled-up his hometown fave - wildflower honey.
