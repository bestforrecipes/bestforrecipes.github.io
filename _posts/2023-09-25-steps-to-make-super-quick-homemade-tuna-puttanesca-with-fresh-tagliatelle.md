##### Instructions to make Tuna Puttanesca with Fresh Tagliatelle:

1.  Soak the olives and capers in water for about 10 minutes.
2.  Finely chop the garlic, anchovies, olives and capers. Bring the water to cook the pasta to a boil.
3.  Put the olive oil, garlic, anchovies, olives, capers and tuna in a frying pan, and sauté over medium heat.
4.  When the garlic is cooked (before it starts burning), add the butter. When it's melted, take the frying pan off the heat and put in the white wine.
5.  Start cooking the pasta.
6.  Put the pan back on the heat and evaporate the alcohol in the wine. Add the tomato sauce, season with salt and pepper and taste. If it tastes a bit salty, it is just right.
