5.  Make ready twigs fresh sage

Mince onions and lightly sauté them in a pan on a medium heat.

##### Steps to make Shishito and Mushooms sauté:

1.  So first off this isent the way we do it at work, tbh i think the way we do it at work is better, so for now well do a simple home recipe, but if you do wanna learn they way we do it at work just message me this is just a simple easy way to make a quick snack or side dish for dinner
2.  Ok so this will be the first step grab the oil (2 cups leave 1/2 cup)and herbs and put in a pan at low heat (120-130°) now just rotate herbs in oil to infuse the flavor (now you can add more herbs and oil and save for later) you can also (put it at a high heat and infuse the oil faster but you won't get a fuller more flavorful oil)
3.  While cooking the oil and herbs use 1 cup of the fish sauce and mushrooms, add into a bag and let marinate for about 5 mins
4.  Now get a secondary pan and saute the shishito peppers with the 1/2 cup oil that's left over, saute till half cooked (has some sear to it and still very crunchy)
5.  Now with the herbs and oil still sitting in the pan, drain and keep most oil for future use (about 1 cup) and add mushrooms and marinade into pan and cook till half cooked (tender but still chewy)
6.  Put all ingredients together, add garlic powder and saute till done (add more oil and fish oil to taste)
7.  Take out herbs in pan and serve!!!

In a bowl, add ground beef, egg, salt and pepper. Green Shishito chile peppers are best suited for lightly cooked applications such as blistering, grilling, sautéing, and roasting. When cooked, the pod's peppery taste develops a richer flavor and becomes slightly smoky, which complements salty and savory sauces. Sauteed mushrooms with a hint of wine and teriyaki sauce are the perfect topper for steak and baked potatoes. I used sliced baby bella mushrooms and insteaf of using garlic salt, I used Penzey's Shallot Salt.
