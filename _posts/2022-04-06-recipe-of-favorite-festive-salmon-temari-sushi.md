Hello everybody, it is Drew, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, festive salmon temari sushi. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Temari sushi - 手まり寿司 - or temarizushi - are round balls of sushi rice topped decoratively with ingredients like sashimi, vegetables, seaweed sheets and fish roe. Typically molded onto the iconic round shape using plastic wrap, they can be garnished as elaborately or as simply as you'd like. Temari Sushi is balls of sushi rice wrapped up in anything you like - thinly sliced fish, avocado, omelette, prawns or my favourite, smoked salmon.

Festive Salmon Temari Sushi is one of the most well liked of current trending meals on earth. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It is appreciated by millions daily. They are fine and they look wonderful. Festive Salmon Temari Sushi is something that I have loved my entire life.

To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have festive salmon temari sushi using 8 ingredients and 10 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Festive Salmon Temari Sushi:

1.  Get 20 pieces if thin, 10 pieces if thick Salmon (sashimi-grade)
2.  Make ready 10 Capers
3.  Prepare For the sushi rice:
4.  Prepare 500 grams Freshly cooked rice
5.  Take 50 ml Vinegar
6.  Get 1 equal amount as the vinegar Sugar
7.  Take 1 tsp Salt
8.  Get 1 follow the instructions on the packaging (If using commercial sushi vinegar)

Made from sushi rice, slices of salmon, and nori seaweed for face decorations; these little. Temari are small cloth balls made from leftover scraps of kimono fabric, and temari zushi are meant to look like these colorful toys. Following up on the previous recipe for shell shaped sushi, here is another kind of sushi that's great for parties. Temari are small cloth balls made from leftover scraps.

##### Steps to make Festive Salmon Temari Sushi:

1.  I used this thinly sliced salmon this time.
2.  Make the sushi vinegar: Put the vinegar, sugar and salt in a small pan, and warm up while stirring to dissolve the sugar. (This one is brown because I used 100% rice vinegar.)
3.  Put the freshly cooked hot rice in a bowl or similar, and swirl on the sushi vinegar.
4.  Cut and fold to mix with a rice paddle, taking care not to mash the rice grains.
5.  When the sushi vinegar is evenly mixed in, and there are no lumps of rice, fan it to cool it down. This will make the sushi rice very shiny.
6.  Spread out a piece of plastic wrap on a scale, and place the sashimi on top. Since the sashimi I used this time was very thin I used 2 slices. If you have thicker slices of sashimi, 1 is fine.
7.  Set the scale to 0 (use the TARE function if you're using a digital scale) and put on 50 g of sushi rice. The rice sticks to the spoon, so dip the spoon in water each time. Add wasabi if you like.
8.  Twist the wrap tightly, and form a nice round ball. Keep the sushi wrapped in plastic to prevent it from drying out until it's time to serve them.
9.  Arrange them just before eating them. Top with capers to finish. Just one caper per piece made them look like shumai dumplings to me, so I put on 2 per piece.
10.  You can also form the sushi by putting a caper on the plastic wrap, then the sashimi, followed by the rice.
