##### Steps to make Mike's "What The Fuh?" Phở:

1.  Here's what you'll need. Fresh herbs not pictured here.
2.  Create your broth by adding everything in the Basic Broth section. Heat well.
3.  Pan toast all of your dried herbs for 2 to 3 minutes. When you can smell them - they're fully toasted.
4.  Add all of your Phở seasonings to a piece of cheese cloth.
5.  Seal toasted herb bag tightly.
6.  Add herb bag to broth and simmer for 45 minutes.
7.  At the same time, prepare your water to boil your noodles. Add a dash of salt and oil to water.
8.  Pull herb bag from broth and disgard. Then, fine strain your broth twice. You'll want it extra clear and clean for service.
9.  Or, go with a clean chicken broth. Your choice.
10.  Rinse dried or wipe down fresh mushrooms, then slice. Place in simmering broth for 15 minutes. 5 minutes if using fresh mushrooms. I usually pull out the dried just before serving but my students wanted them left in.
11.  Boil noodles as per manufacturers directions then drain. Do not rinse noodles.
12.  Prepare your chilled sides while waiting for noodles.
13.  Char your onions.
14.  Char your ginger.
15.  Add raw thin sliced beef and hot noodles to individual bowls.
16.  Add your super hot broth asap to bowls to keep noodles from drying out. Plus it'll give you time to quickly decorate your bowls with meats, seafoods and all garnishments.
17.  Add your brisket slices and shrimp to the top of your bowls but submerged. Serve with any of the side options with chopsticks and deep Asian soup spoons. Enjoy!
