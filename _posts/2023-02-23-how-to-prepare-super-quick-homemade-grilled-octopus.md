To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook grilled octopus using 8 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Grilled Octopus:

1.  Take 900 g octopus (baby, medium or large)
2.  Take Juice of one lemon (use less if preferred)
3.  Take Olive oil
4.  Get 3 garlic cloves, finely diced
5.  Prepare to taste Salt
6.  Prepare to taste Freshly ground black pepper
7.  Take 1/2 dried oregano (I used wild oregano)
8.  Make ready 1 bunch fresh chopped parsley

##### Instructions to make Grilled Octopus:

1.  I always boil the octopus first. I boil it anywhere between 45 minutes to 120 minutes depending on how soft I want the octopus to become. I asked the fishmonger to prepare the octopus for ease so it was literally just adding it to slightly salted water and allowing it to boil.
2.  Remove the octopus from the pot, rinse under cold water and allow to cool to room temperature for 30-60 minutes before grilling. While cooling drizzle some olive over the octopus and add the garlic to marinade.
3.  This is so much better on the barbecue but as its middle of winter here, I had to settle for a grill pan. So heat it up to medium/high heat, slice the tentacles to cook individually. Grill on each side for 3-5 minutes.
4.  Place in a bowl and drizzle the lemon juice, some more olive oil, parsley and oregano. Season with salt and pepper then gently toss the octopus in the sauce and serve.
