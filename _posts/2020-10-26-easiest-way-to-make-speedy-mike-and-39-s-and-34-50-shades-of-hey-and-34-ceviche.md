##### Steps to make Mike's "50 Shades of HEY!" Ceviche:

1.  Chop all chilled veggies except for the Avacados and place in an extra large bowl. Avocado spoils and browns much too quickly to ever incorporate it directly \[unless you're serving it immediately\] regardless if you've seasoned with lime juice. The acidity in this dish may negatively react to some metals giving your Ceviche a tin or metallic taste so be sure to use a plastic bowl or another non-metal option.
2.  De-thaw all seafood in cold water. Once thawed, cut Scallops in half or thirds \[if using the large ones\] and shread the Imitation Crab Meat in larger chunks as they will fall apart during mixing. I use imitation crab meat since it lasts much longer than real crab without spoiling and doesn't overpower the dish. Leave the Shrimp in tact but de-husk, de-vein and de-tail them if necessary. Place all seafood in your vegetable bowl.
3.  Pour in chilled Clamato Juice 2" to 3" inches from the top of your ingredients, 2/3 bottle of chilled Tabasco, 1/2 of your chilled Spicy V8, Worcestershire Sauce and your chilled fruit juices.
4.  Add all spices and fold in gently.
5.  Taste test juice for spiciness and add more of your bottle of Tabasco and a little more of your Spicy V8 if it suits your pallet. I adore a spicy Ceviche so I usually end up using the entire 12 ozs of the bottle of Tabasco in this dish.
6.  This Ceviche is best after sitting for 24 hours or 10 hours at the very least. As it sits and chills, gently stir it every few hours to ensure the seafood absorbs the colors, juices and spices.
7.  Serve in a large chilled chalice or glass rimmed with juice, lime juice and Tabasco Seasoned Salt or regular salt/sea salt, fresh quality crackers or toasted Baguettes of your choosing, an ice cold Mexican beer, \[such as Corona\] lime wedges, Avacado slices and a side bottle of Tabasco for your more adventurous guests!
8.  You can also serve this dish in lettuce wraps or even edible parmesan bowls. Get creative! Enjoy! - - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/357097-mikes-ez-edible-parmesan-bowls](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/357097-mikes-ez-edible-parmesan-bowls)
