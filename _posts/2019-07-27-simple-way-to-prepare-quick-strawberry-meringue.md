Hey everyone, I hope you’re having an amazing day today. Today, I’m gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, strawberry meringue. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Strawberry Meringue is one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It’s simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions every day. They’re fine and they look fantastic. Strawberry Meringue is something which I have loved my whole life.

With that, I'm sharing a strawberry meringue recipe. There is nothing like a good meringue and this recipe hits all the best things: crisp exterior and a chewy inside—all with a swirl of fruity sweetness. Aside from that, I just love the way meringues looks—so pretty—and everyone knows pretty food tastes better.

To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can have strawberry meringue using 5 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Strawberry Meringue:

1.  Prepare 150 g strawberries
2.  Make ready 200 ml double cream
3.  Take As needed powdered sugar (optional)
4.  Get 4 ready made meringue shells or make your own
5.  Prepare 1 chocolate flake

This was time saving and turned out delicious. Carefully remove the meringues from paper. Add the meringue cookies to the dessert glasses, over the cream layer. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside.

##### Instructions to make Strawberry Meringue:

1.  Prepare the strawberries and cut them in half or quarters depending on how big the strawberries are.
2.  In a bowl whip the double cream until it becomes stiff.
3.  Add the whipped cream to the top of the shells.
4.  Using your fingers break the chocolate into flakes. And sprinkle over the cream.
5.  Then layer them with the strawberries.
6.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired.

In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites, cream of. Remove from oven; cool completely on baking sheets. Dip bottoms in melted chocolate; allow excess to drip off. But this is NOT the strawberry meringue buttercream frosting recipe in Stewart's Cupcakes book. The book uses fresh, pureed strawberries, which when added to the egg whites & sugar turn it into a pink soup that can not be saved.
