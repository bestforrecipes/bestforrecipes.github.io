3.  In a large wok or saute pan, bring 2 teaspoons of oil up to high heat, then stir fry the octopus _just_ until all the pieces turn opaque. Set aside in a large dish or platter. No need to salt the octopus if it hasn't been rinsed of the salt from the ocean water.
4.  Keeping the heat on high, preheat 1 Tablespoon of oil in your wok/saute pan, and stir fry half your veg, just until they all get a bit of sear. (If this is the batch with your onions, onions _just_ starting to turn translucent is a good indication of when they're ready.) - - Season with just a pinch of salt and set aside with the octopus.
5.  Repeat Step 4 with the rest of your veg.
6.  Keeping the heat on high, put 2 Tablespoons oil in your wok/saute pan, and add your paste right after. Give it a good stir so the oil will lightly cook the garlic and ginger and caramelize the sugar in the paste. This should only take 15 to 20 seconds.
7.  Keeping the heat on high, add the octopus and veg back into the wok/saute pan along with 1/4 cup water, and toss thoroughly until all the paste/sauce is well integrated with the octopus and veg. - - That's it! Enjoy with a bowl of steamed rice. :)
