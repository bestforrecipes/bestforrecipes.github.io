##### The ingredients needed to make Gooey Easy Breakfast or Lunch Chewy Crepes:

1.  Prepare Cake flour
2.  Prepare Water
3.  Prepare Salt
4.  Get Shredded cheese (melting type cheese) or 2 slices of sandwich cheese
5.  Take Ham, bacon, wiener sausages, eggs, imitation crab sticks, etc…your favorite fillings

##### Steps to make Gooey Easy Breakfast or Lunch Chewy Crepes:

1.  Measure the flour and water and combine in a cup. Add a tiny bit of salt and stir it together. (Salt is optional.) It's probably best to tear up the sliced cheese.
2.  You can use any fillings you want, such as ham, bacon, wiener sausages, meat sauce, etc. Lightly cook whatever filling you choose in a frying pan and then push aside to the edges or remove from the pan.
3.  If the frying pan is dirty, wipe it clean quickly. Spread a thin layer of oil on the surface (if using a Teflon nonstick pan, you don't need oil.) Pour in Step 1 and cook both sides on low heat.
4.  Top with the filling from Step 2. Sprinkle with cheese and wrap up the crepe.
5.  Once you feel that the cheese has melted, it's done.
6.  By the way, for the fillings in these I used yesterday's leftover sweet and salty beef with cheese.
7.  \[Note\] Everything is just approximate but cook one side for 1-1.5 minutes, turn it over, and cook the other side for 30-60 seconds.
8.  Depending on how I'm feeling or the fillings I'm using, I sometimes cook them until they become crispy. Adjust the cooking time if you want them to be more chewy. Just cook them as you like.
