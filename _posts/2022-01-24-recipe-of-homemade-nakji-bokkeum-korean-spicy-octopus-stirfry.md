3.  In a large wok or saute pan, bring 2 teaspoons of oil up to high heat, then stir fry the octopus _just_ until all the pieces turn opaque. Set aside in a large dish or platter. No need to salt the octopus if it hasn't been rinsed of the salt from the ocean water.
4.  Keeping the heat on high, preheat 1 Tablespoon of oil in your wok/saute pan, and stir fry half your veg, just until they all get a bit of sear.
