Shrimp ties with salmon as our favorite seafood, and though it was once reserved for special occasions, today we enjoy this shellfish for dinner on the regular. Yet shrimp cocktail somehow remains singular, associated most frequently with celebratory meals out. Shrimp cocktail is all about the shrimp: big, fat, perfectly cooked gorgeous shrimp. Shrimp Cocktail is a classic party appetizer that needs to be at your next gathering!

##### Instructions to make Shrimp cocktail:

1.  boil shrimp in salt water (large pot, 1Tbsp salt) if shrimp r precooked defrost fully in cold water instead of boiling them. tips: bring water to boil before throwing shrimp in, they will float to the surface when done. dont leave the shrimp in too long, you want them tender not chewy!
2.  cool shrimp in cold water ( ice speeds up the process of coarse.) when cooled, or defrosted, peel shrimp and devein (to devein shrimp, run a paring knife along the outer curve of the shrimp almost 1/4in deep from top to bottom youll see it!) its poop u dont want to eat that part!
3.  throw the shrimp in the bowl with all other ingredients, toss well, but gently u dont want to mash the avocado or tomatoes… chill for atleast an hour n enjoy! great with saltine crackers and a slice of lime
4.  a great add-in is chunked octopus.

This party favorite is easy to throw together and can be made in advance. Every holiday party needs Shrimp Cocktail! It's a simple and delicious appetizer that everyone know and loves.
