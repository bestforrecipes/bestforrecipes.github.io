##### The ingredients needed to make Low-Sugar Okonomiyaki-Style Okara Pancakes:

7.  Take 200 grams Bean sprouts
8.  Get 150 grams Pork shoulder roast chunks

##### Steps to make Low-Sugar Okonomiyaki-Style Okara Pancakes:

1.  Use the fresh okara as-is. Rehydrate as per the instructions if using a dried kind. I used a type that's rehydrated in 5 parts water. I added 30 g to 150 g water.
2.  Combine the ☆ ingredients with Step 1 as they are listed in the ingredients list, and level it all out with a spatula. Fresh okara will have a higher water content, so adjust the amount of water to the point where it feels a little lacking in moisture.
3.  Add your preferred ingredients, and mix by hand. This time I used bean sprouts washed and broken up by massaging the bag, and pork bits with the fat cut off.
4.  Press down and remove the air and form a patty so that it becomes 1/4 in size. Coat a heated frying pan with oil, and place the patty into the pan. Make another patty in the same manner and put it into the frying pan as well.
5.  Cover with a lid, cook one side on medium for 4 minutes, flip over, and cook the other side for an additional 4 minutes. Shape 2 more patties, and cook them.
6.  (These are small enough to pick up with a spatula and shouldn't fall apart easily, but might a little when flipping…)
7.  Serve onto plates, cover with okonomiyaki sauce and mayonnaise, top with dried bonito flakes or aonori seaweed, and enjoy (with plenty of water).
8.  Store leftovers in the fridge or freezer. They can be microwaved and served again. They will have a milder taste the next day than when they are freshly made.
