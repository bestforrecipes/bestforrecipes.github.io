##### The ingredients needed to make Roast Corn Rice with Canned Corn:

4.  Take 1 ＊ Butter
5.  Get 1 ＊ Aonori

##### Steps to make Roast Corn Rice with Canned Corn:

1.  Drain the canned corn well, and add the corn to a frying pan (don't need oil). Once the moisture has cooked off, add the soy sauce and test the flavor.
2.  Add the rice, and top with aonori seaweed if you like. For seconds, mix in a bit of butter for a more western taste.
