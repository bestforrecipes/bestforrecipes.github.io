##### The ingredients needed to make Prawn and oyster dumplings:

1.  Prepare 24 medium size prawns
2.  Take 12 oysters

Add six or seven dumplings to the water and stir immediately to prevent them from sticking to the bottom or together. Devein the prawns and then take off the tails. This dumpling recipe I have is steamed and composed of prawns and spring onion and of course some spices and flavorings. You can also use chives which is very similar to spring onion in appearance and taste.

##### Instructions to make Prawn and oyster dumplings:

1.  Shuck the oysters and cut in half lengthways and add to the whole prawns. (deveined if they need it)
2.  Chop the other ingredients except the star anise finely and add to the other ingredients (you only want the star anise in the mixture not in the dumplings). Add the lime juice and mix vigorously to spread the flavour of the oysters through the mix.
3.  If you can't get galangal use a little more ginger.
4.  Wet the edges of a gyoza or dumpling wrapper and place a Prawn, a piece of oyster and some of the rest of the ingredients in the centre and pull the sides up to the top and hold together till they stick and become a dumpling.
5.  Place on a cabbage leaf in a steamer and steam for 5 mins
6.  Mix the dip ingredients together and serve in a bowl with the dumplings

Spring onions is readily available than chives so I prefer to use it than chives. This is a great Cantonese style dumpling that combines a filling of seasoned pork mince and a whole prawn; it can be fried or boiled to serve. Put mince and prawn in a medium bowl and stir to combine.
