2.  In a pan add milk, water, pasta and the soup stock, then turn on the heat and cook.
3.  To prevent over-boiling, watch and reduce the heat to medium if needed. Compared to normal pasta cooking times, increase the boiling time by 2 minutes. Make sure not to lower the heat too much or it won't cook properly.
