Grilled Fajitas is one of the most favored of recent trending meals on earth. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions every day. They’re nice and they look fantastic. Grilled Fajitas is something which I have loved my whole life.

Preheat a grill over medium-high heat and lightly oil the grates with vegetable oil. Beef top round steak marinated in fajita seasoning is grilled, sliced, and served wrapped in tortillas with grilled peppers and onions and topped with salsa. Top with vegetables and roll up.

To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook grilled fajitas using 12 ingredients and 10 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Grilled Fajitas:

1.  Get steak or chicken breast
2.  Prepare bell peppers (color doesn't matter)
3.  Prepare red onion
4.  Take fresh garlic clove finely minced
5.  Make ready pace picante sauce
6.  Get tequilla
7.  Get burrito tortilla shells
8.  Get shredded cheese
9.  Take sour cream (optional)
10.  Take rice (optional)
11.  Get guacamole (optional)
12.  Make ready lime juice

It's my favorite beef fajita recipe, by far! Grilling the beef really makes a difference in flavor and the blend of spices are perfect. However, if you don't want to grill, the beef can be done using a cast iron pan on the stovetop. The beef will have a more intense flavor if you let it sit in the refrigerator for a few.

##### Steps to make Grilled Fajitas:

1.  Take your choice of meat and place it in a large bowl or plastic bag along with the garlic, picante sauce, lime juice and tequila.
2.  Cut the bell pepper in half and clean out the hearts and place in the bowl with the meat.
3.  Slice the red onion into 1/4" slices and place in the bowl with the meat and peppers.
4.  Let the meat, peppers and onions marinade for 2 to 24 hours, flipping the bowl over periodically to make sure everything is covered.
5.  Once marinaded, remove the meat, peppers, and onions from the marinade, and place them on a grill. Cook the peppers & onions with indirect heat, while the meat cooks over the direct heat. I cook the steak until they are medium to medium well.
6.  Take the left over marinade, and place it in a sauce pan.
7.  Once the food is cooked, slice the meat, and peppers into 1/8" strips, and cut the onion slices to desired length. While you are slicing, turn a flame on the sauce pan of marinade. Bring to a boil for 3 minutes and then simmer until you are done slicing. I like this part because I sample as I go for quality control purposes of course.
8.  Dump the sliced food into a bowl, and combine with the heated marinade. Mix everything well.
9.  Spoon meat and veggies onto a tortilla shell and add cheese and the optional ingredients.
10.  Roll the tortilla and enjoy!

TO GRILL THE STEAK FAJITAS: …ON A CHARCOAL GRILL: If using a charcoal grill: fill one grill chimney with charcoal and light it. When top coals are mostly covered with gray ash, pour the coals over one side of the charcoal grate. Clean and oil the grill after the grill preheats. For the Fajita Marinade: Combine soy sauce, lime juice, canola oil, brown sugar, cumin, black pepper, chili powder, and garlic in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. They're usually served with flour tortillas on the side and other condiments like guacamole, salsa, sour cream and/or cheese that can be rolled into the tortillas with the meat.
