2.  When water comes to a rapid boil, add squid and prawns; cook for 2 minutes and remove from pot.
3.  When cooled, peel the prawn shell (leaving the tail on); return the prawn heads and shells back to the soup pot.
4.  Slice the squid to thin rings.
5.  Continue simmering the stock for 40 minutes and strain the broth. Season the stock with fish sauce and dark soy sauce. Yields about 500ml of rich prawn stock.
6.  For making Hokkien Mee: Heat 1 tbsp oil in wok and add beaten egg. Scramble the egg quickly with a spatula until it is semi set.
7.  Add yellow noodles, rice vermicelli, bean sprouts, another tbsp of oil and 2 ladles of prawn stock. Stir fry on high heat for 1 minute.
8.  Push the wok contents to one side, add another 1 tbsp oil to the wok. Stir fry garlic and lard pieces for 15 seconds.
9.  Add chives, mix everything together, add 2 more ladles of stock and cover with lid to simmer/braise for 3 mins.
10.  Turn off the heat. Ladle the remaining stock over the cooked noodles. Return the prepared prawns and squid into the hot wok and mix in evenly with the noodles.
11.  Divide and portion to four serving plates. Serve each plate with a cut lime and some sambal at the side.
