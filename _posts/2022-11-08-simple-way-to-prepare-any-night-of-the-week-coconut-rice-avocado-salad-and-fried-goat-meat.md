##### Instructions to make Coconut rice, avocado salad and fried goat meat:

1.  The first step is to prepare the ingredients for the coconut fried rice. If you don't have chicken stock, You can also use plain water, but you'll have to add extra seasoning to make the coconut fried rice as tasty as when stock is used.
2.  Parboil the rice place in a sieve to drain out excess water. Tip: Parboiling helps to reduce the starchy content of the rice which makes the grains to clump together when cooking If you are ''anti-parboiling'', no problem, but I strongly advice this when making coconut fried rice because the oil from the coconut milk tends to clump the rice and makes it sticky
3.  Pour the chicken stock and coconut milk into a large pot and bring to a boil. As the mixture starts to boil, add 1 seasoning cube(stock cube), 2 tablespoons curry powder, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, half of the diced onions and salt to taste. Mix well and add the parboiled rice. Leave to cook on medium heat.level as the rice, so that it dries up completely when the rice is done. If you don't have stock, double the seasoning you'll be using and use water and coconut milk
4.  When the rice is starts to bubble, place the cleaned shrimps on top of the rice and leave to cook until the rice is done.  Mix well, open the pot and leave the rice to cool a bit. Now heat up the oil; add the diced carrots, sweet corn, peas, red&green bell pepper and diced liver/meat(if using); then add the white/black pepper, ginger, and the remaining garlic, curry &seasoning cube to taste, stir fry for 1 min then add all the veggies into the pot of coconut rice and mix togeth
5.  After which your coconut rice is ready.
6.  Note\* if you want a very strong coconuty flavour add 2 to 4 cup of coconut oil to be use when stir frying the veggies.
