##### Steps to make Shrimp Etoufee:

1.  Remove heads from prawns.
2.  Add top of green pepper, peppercorns, 1 celery stalk chopped, 3 bay leaves, fat garlic clove chopped, half an onion chopped to a pot with the prawn heads and shells.
3.  Cover with water and simmer for 45 minutes. Strain through a sieve.
4.  Set aside 1 heaped tablespoon of Cajun seasoning.
5.  Dry prawns with paper towels. Put them on a plate and cover with remaining Cajun seasoning and half a teaspoon of salt.
6.  Heat a tablespoon butter in a cast iron pan on a medium heat.
7.  Cook shrimp in the hot butter without stirring for 1 minute; stir, and cook 1 minute more.
8.  Transfer to a bowl (they should still be somewhat raw)
9.  Heat the oil in the cast iron pan over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the flour, making sure there are no clumps. Let this cook, stirring often, until it turns a very deep brown; this should take about 15 minutes or so.
10.  Add the celery, green pepper, and onion, mix well and cook this over medium heat for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook another 2 minutes
11.  Add the shrimp stock slowly. The roux will absorb the stock and seize up at first, then it will loosen. Add additional stock as needed to make a sauce about the thickness of gravy.
12.  Add the Cajun seasoning and paprika and mix well. Simmer for 30 minutes or so with a lid on (or off if you’d like a thicker consistency)
13.  Increase the temperature and add salt to taste, then mix in the shrimp. Cover the pot, turn the heat to its lowest setting and cook for 5 minutes.
14.  Serve with steamed rice, Tabasco and green onions.
