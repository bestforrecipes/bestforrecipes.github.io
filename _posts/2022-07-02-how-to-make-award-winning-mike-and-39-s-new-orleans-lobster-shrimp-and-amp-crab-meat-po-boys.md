##### Steps to make Mike's New Orleans Lobster, Shrimp & Crab Meat Po Boys:

1.  Presteamed Langistino Lobster Tails pictured. Rinse, rough chop and add to a large bowl.
2.  1 lb raw Rock Lobster pictured. Rinse and set to the side. Prepare to steam them later.
3.  Cut lobsters down the middle of the upper shell with sharp kitchen shears.
4.  1 lb Pre-steamed Jumbo Shrimp. Rinse, de-shell, de-vein if needed, rough chop and add to your large bowl with Langistino tails.
5.  I use fresh pre-steamed crab claws. Just crack open and shread meat. Add to large bowl.
6.  But, \[real\] canned crab meat works as well. If opting for canned - drain and carefully sift thru it for any shells.
7.  In a pan with a lifted rack and tight fitting lid - add these ingredients to taste. Butter - White Wine - Minced Garlic - Fresh Lemon Juice - Lemon Pepper - Old Bay and bring all to a simmer. Add what you'd like and how you'd like it but don't allow your fluids to rise above your rack and touch your lobster tails. You want to steam - not boil.
8.  Drizzle a bit of your melted sauce on top of your lobster tails and into the slits you made earlier. Steam with tight fitting lid for 7 to 8 minutes. Don't peek tho! ;0)
9.  Pull lobster tails, de-shell and rough chop meat. I'll always use the leftover lobster butter juices for a quick, simple steamed Baby Ukon Gold Potato, white onion and green pepper dish. Waste not want not right?
10.  Use 12" Leidenheimer loaves if you want an authentic NOLA Po Boy. Be sure to lightly toast them! üòÜ
11.  Simply place seafood atop crispy butter leaf lettuce and French buns. Also, serve with hot sauce and chilled pickles to the side.
12.  If opting to put your seafood mixture on toasted bagles - simply toast and smear cream cheese at base.
13.  Add a piece of butter leaf lettuce - add seafood mixture with a squeeze of lemon - then another piece of lettuce to keep your bread nice and crunchy!
14.  Viola!
15.  Quite possibly the BEST chilled pickles out there! They're firm and crazy delicious! You'll only find them in your refrigerated isle of your local chain supermarket.
16.  Enjoy this tiny extra rich little taste of NOLA y'all!

It has an intense, complicated flavor that comes from making a patiently toasted roux, cajun spices, shrimp stock and finally okra which makes this thick, rich stew But but but don't close the window yet because trust me when I say - you WILL want to try this New Orleans sausage shrimp gumbo!
