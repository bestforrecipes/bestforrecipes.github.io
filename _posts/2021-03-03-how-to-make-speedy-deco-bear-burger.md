##### Instructions to make DECO Bear Burger:

1.  Drain tofu by wrapping in kitchen paper. Leave for a while to allow the paper to absorb the water from the tofu. Chop all vegetables into small pieces. Put all ingredients into a bowl and mix until the texture becomes sticky.
2.  Form mixture into 3 balls. One is for the face, so should be bit bigger than the other two smaller balls, which are for the ears. Heat olive oil in a pan, and fry the burgers with medium heat with the lid on. Once one side is cooked and browned nicely, turn and fry the other side without the lid on.
3.  While the burgers are cooking, prepare the bear's face! Cut the sliced cheese into a circle for face, and smaller semi-circles for ears. Cut seaweed for eyes and mouth, using a "deco cutter." Finally, add ketchup for lovely rosy cheeks.
4.  You can find a deco cutter in stationary stores in Japan. The lid of a plastic bottle is helpful for cutting cheese in perfect circles.
