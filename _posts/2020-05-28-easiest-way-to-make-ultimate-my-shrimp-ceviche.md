##### Instructions to make My Shrimp Ceviche:

1.  Raw: Lime only. Squeeze about 8 limes and add raw uncooked shrimp. Then refrigerate for NO less than 4 -5 hours. Make certain it is all pink. If you are pregnant, DO NOT eat the lime only "cooked" shrimp!!! You must use pre-heated water first.
2.  Pre-heated: Boil some hot water. Turn the burner off and add shrimp. (If you are pregnant or in a hurry, use this step!) Let the shrimp sit in the hot water a minimum of 3-5 minutes. The shrimp is done when it's pink.
3.  Now. If you used the boiled water, squeeze about 8 limes. Cut the shrimp into small pieces. Add the shrimp and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Make certain in either case ( heated or raw) that the lime juice covers the shrimp completely.
4.  In the meantime, cut up red and green bell peppers, onion, tomato, and garlic. Cut up some cucumber and cilantro.
5.  After 10 minutes , take the shrimp covered in lime juice out of the refrigerator. Add the peppers, onion, tomato, and garlic. Stir. If you went lime only "cooked", the process is the same after 4-5 hours in the fridge.
6.  When you are near serving, place a small amount of the lime juice in a nice glass. Let the actual mixture sit out for a few minutes to come to room temperature.
7.  When you are ready to serve, add the cucumber, avocado, and cilantro. Stir.
