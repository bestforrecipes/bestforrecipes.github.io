##### The ingredients needed to make Fish kebabs:

##### Steps to make Fish kebabs:

1.  Assemble the kebabs. I prefer using wooden skewers rather than metal ones for BBQs and like to try
2.  different combinations of fish and veg. Cut generous squares of the fish or ask the fishmonger to do it for you
3.  Squeeze the juice of the limes over the fish, turning to get all sides juiced. Add salt and pepper and leave for 10 minutes
4.  When the embers are ready, grill the kebabs. If you have a two-layer barbecue you can put another vegetable on the top one. I sliced and olive-oiled some onions and grilled those and the onion juice drizzling during cooking onto the kebabs added a nice touch to their flavour
