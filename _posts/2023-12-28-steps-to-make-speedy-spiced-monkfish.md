**Spiced monkfish**

Hello everybody, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, spiced monkfish. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

The monkfish is lightly salted and rested before being coated in the black curry powder and cooked in the oven. The shellfish stock is best made from cooked mussels, alternatively, use clam juice or good quality fish stock. Don't forget to sprinkle monkfish chunks with salt for at least half an hour, to draw moisture out.

Spiced monkfish is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals on earth. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It’s simple, it’s quick, it tastes delicious. They’re nice and they look fantastic. Spiced monkfish is something which I’ve loved my entire life.

To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook spiced monkfish using 11 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Spiced monkfish:

1.  Get 1 monkfish tail fillet per person (scale up the other ingredients if cooking for more than 2)
2.  Get 1 tsp Korean chili powder
3.  Take 1/2 tsp turmeric (or 2 tsp curry powder instead of the two spices)
4.  Get 1/2 tsp fine salt
5.  Take 1 shallot, finely diced
6.  Make ready 2 cm ginger root, peeled and chopped into small matchsticks
7.  Prepare 2 tbsp. butter
8.  Prepare 1 pinch saffron
9.  Get about 50ml chicken stock made with a stock cube or fresh
10.  Prepare 2 tbsp. crème fraiche
11.  Take 1 little chopped parsley

Heat butter in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Pan-fry monkfish fillets along with marinade for five minutes on each side, or until the color turns from translucent white to solid white. The sweet, meaty lightness of monkfish goes particularly well with pork, benefiting from the meat's natural saltiness. Chris Horridge uses Parma ham to wrap the monkfish in his wonderful Sous vide fish recipe, while Marcus Wareing uses a spiced chorizo crust in his Monkfish with beans recipe.

##### Steps to make Spiced monkfish:

1.  Monkfish needs firming up before cooking, otherwise it releases a lot of water whilst cooking. Sprinkle the fillets generously with salt, chill for at least half an hour then rinse off the salt and pat dry.
2.  Cut the fish into scallop-sized chunks. Mix the spices and salt together and dip the monkfish pieces in the mix.
3.  Melt the butter over medium-high heat, add the monkfish pieces, the diced shallot and ginger and cook for a minute. Sprinkle the saffron over the dish and turn the monkfish pieces over.
4.  Turn the heat up, add the crème fraiche and the stock and bubble away for another 1-2 minutes. Transfer to serving bowls or dishes and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve with plain rice.

Monkfish has been called "the poor man's lobster". It is a tender white fish that tastes a bit like lobster. Only the tail of the monkfish is actually edible but it's delicious. I have gotten monkfish at the Asian market, but if you can't find it, you can substitute snapper, sea bass, halibut, cod, mahi-mahi or sea scallops. Expensive because it's overfished, monkfish is sometimes called 'poor man's lobster' but pound for pound, depending on where you are, you might have to cough up the same for your dinner, whether you go for lobster or the fish.
