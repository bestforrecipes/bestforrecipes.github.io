1.  Dice the onions and mushrooms. Sautee in olive oil.

4.  Add canned ingredients to crockpot. Stir to thoroughly mix. (Note: if you use dried kidney beans then soak ~1-2 cups overnight. Drain and rinse).
5.  Add sauteed chicken, onions and mushrooms. Add water to cover ingredients and stir to mix.
6.  Add spices to taste. Start bland and gradually add salsa and chili powder. Optional: use a taco favoring packet if acceptable to the tastes of your household.
7.  Set crockpot to high and cook ~4 hours or until kidney beans are done. Add water if it becomes too thick.
8.  Heat one taco shell per person (follow directions on the box). Most will break it up to add to soup while others may use it as a "scoop".
9.  Garnish with shredded cheese (or a dollop of low fat sour cream mixed with a chopped green onion stem).
