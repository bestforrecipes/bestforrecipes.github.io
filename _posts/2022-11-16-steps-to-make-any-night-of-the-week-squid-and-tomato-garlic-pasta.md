Given squid's mild flavor, the tomato sauce really dictates which wine to serve with this dish. Cook the squid over medium high heat, stirring often, until the pieces go from translucent to opaque, and look white. Then add the tomatoes, garlic, oregano and white wine. Bright red tomatos are peeled and chopped and cooked very briefly with tomato paste and sauteed garlic to make a fresh and colorful sauce for hot pasta.

##### Steps to make Squid and Tomato Garlic Pasta:

1.  Remove the guts from the squid and cut it into bite-sized pieces. Thinly slice the garlic and onion.
2.  Put a teaspoon of salt in a generous amount of hot water, and begin boiling the pasta.
3.  Put the garlic, red chilli pepper and olive oil in a frying pan and stir-fry over low heat. When browned, add the onion and turn up the heat to medium.
4.  When the onion has wilted, add the squid. When the colour changes, stir in the ingredients marked ★. Turn the heat off once it has come to the boil.
5.  Boil the pasta so it is slightly on the firm side. Add it to the sauce, and turn the heat to high.
6.  Mix the pasta well while letting the sauce evaporate. Season with salt to finish.
7.  Hint: Boil the pasta for 1-2 minutes less than indicated on the package.

Stir in fresh basil just before combining the sauce with the pasta, then top with Parmesan cheese. I have always been emphatically anti-tomato when it comes to seafood sauces, liking my spaghetti alle vongole and any similarly conceived dish strictly in bianco. I don't renounce my previous preferences, but find I am now an enthusiastic consumer of the more southerly and less elegant red sauces, too. I certainly love the gutsiness of this fiery, tomatoey squid pasta. Meanwhile, add the octopus and the oil and garlic (from the medium skillet) to the tomato sauce.
