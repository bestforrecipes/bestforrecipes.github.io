##### Steps to make Omelette with Salt-Flavored Fried Noodles Using Instant Ramen:

1.  We'll use a packet of Sapporo Ichiban Shio (salt-flavored) ramen.
2.  Prep work: Slice the green onion thinly. Cut the pork into easy to eat pieces.
3.  Cook the ramen noodles following package directions. Drain in a colander when it's done.
4.  Put the meat and vegetables in a frying pan and stir fry. When they are cooked through, add the ramen noodles.
5.  Add 2 to 3 shakes from the soup packet that comes with the ramen. Taste, and add more if needed.
6.  Attention: If you add the whole soup packet, the noodles will be very salty. It's best to adjust the amount while tasting.
7.  Make the fluffy omelette. Put the ＊ ingredients in a bowl, and beat together to make the egg mixture. Adjust the amounts to taste.
8.  Spread oil in a frying pan and heat. Add the egg mixture. The key is the sizzling sound.
9.  Use 4 chopsticks held together and quickly scramble the egg from the outside towards the middle of the pan. When it starts to cook, stop stirring!
10.  Wrap the omelette around the fried noodles, and transfer to a serving plate.
11.  Tip: If it looks like the omelette will rip, put it on a piece of plastic wrap, mound the noodles in the middle in an oval shape, and use the plastic to wrap the omelette neatly around.
12.  Make the sauce: Just mix the ketchup and sauce together. Use a bit more ketchup than sauce. Okonomiyaki sauce is ok too!
13.  To serve, top the omelette with the sauce, mayonnaise, aonori seaweed powder, bonito flakes, green onions or any other things. Sprinkle sesame seeds that come with the ramen packet to finish.
