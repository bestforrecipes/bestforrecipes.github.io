##### Instructions to make Vickys Coconut Milk 'Cheddar' Cheese, GF DF EF SF NF:

1.  Boil the coconut milk until it's no longer separated. Add the vinegar, agar flakes and salt. Boil gently for 15 minutes (no need to boil 15 minutes if using agar agar powder)
2.  Add the remaining ingredients one at a time, whisking continuously. Cook for another 5 - 10 minutes
3.  Take off the heat and scrape into a greased glass bowl or parchment paper lined small loaf tin
4.  Let cool two hours, it will set at room temperature. If you put in the fridge overnight you can slice and grate it. It's a little slippery though for grating and easier to just slice. If you can't wait to try it spread it on a cracker now lol
5.  Use sliced in sandwiches, top pizzas, melt for mac & cheese or use as a quesadilla filler!
6.  Will make a block the same size as a 300g block of normal cheese but doesn't weigh that much!
7.  The vinegar stops the agar setting so solid that you can't slice it. If you find it sets too hard, increase the vinegar by a half tsp. Likewise if it's too gellatinous, reduce the vinegar to a quarter tsp. I've only tried these 2 kinds of vinegar so I don't know if other varieties make a difference to set or flavour. Different brands of agar also state different setting amounrs on the packets. I use Clearspring brand
