2.  Using your fingers separate the beef if they are clumped together and deep fry it in the oil in small batches (make sure the oil is hot but not smoking â€“ to test if the oil is hot enough, add 1 small piece of beef first and see if it instantly sizzles)
3.  After the beef has marinated, dust 1/2 cup of corn starch on the beef and use your fingers to loosely coat the beef with it. Let it sit for 10 minutes
4.  Deep fry the beef for 1-2 minutes, and remove it from the pot onto a plate with parchment paper or kitchen roll.
5.  For the sauce. Add in all the sauce ingredients, except the corn starch. In the same wok after the beef has cooked drain off the oil and add the sauce ingredients to the wok bring to heat up.
6.  Once all the beef has been cooked then add it with the sugar snap peas and onions cook on low for 3 minutes stirring sauce. It should thicken with the corn starch on the beef if not add a little more cornstarch in a little water like a paste then add it gradually until it's thicker.
7.  Stir until everything is combined well and wait until it comes to a low rolling boil then add the sweet bell peppers and onions. so they will stay crunchy adding them in the end.
