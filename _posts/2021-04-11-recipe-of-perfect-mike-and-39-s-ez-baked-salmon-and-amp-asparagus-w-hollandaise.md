##### Instructions to make Mike's EZ Baked Salmon & Asparagus W/ Hollandaise:

3.  Coat salmon with olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley and lemon zest.
4.  Cut 1" off the woody bottoms of your asparagus. Rinse and dry asparagus.
5.  Lightly coat asparagus with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
6.  Authors Tip: Heat your zested lemon in the microwave for 15 seconds. Then roll it with the palm of your hand. That'll help to fully release its juices without any effort.
7.  Place asparagus on a tin foil lined cookie sheet. Separate asparagus as much as you can for even baking. Squeeze your zested lemon half over your asparagus thru a strainer to collect any seeds.
8.  Place salmon on a tin foil lined cookie sheet and squeeze your other lemon half on top of it.
9.  Bake for 15 minutes at 375°. At 15 check both for doneness. Bake longer if needed based upon the thickness of both your salmon and asparagus and depending upon your individual oven. You'll want a slight crisp to your asparagus and your salmon flaky.
10.  Make your Hollandaise Sauce as per manufactures directions. Knoors will call for 1 cup whole milk and 1/4 cup butter.
