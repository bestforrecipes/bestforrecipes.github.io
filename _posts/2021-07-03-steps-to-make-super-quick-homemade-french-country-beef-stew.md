##### Instructions to make FRENCH COUNTRY BEEF STEW:

1.  In a bowl combine 1/2 cup brandy, beef, 2 tablespoons oil, parsley, salt, thyme, pepper, bay leaves. Coat meat completely
2.  Cover bowl; refrigerate 2 hours, stirring occasionally. After 2 hours, drain meat, reserving marinade.
3.  In large saucepan or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of oil, add meat, a few pieces at a time. Brown on all sides.
4.  Add tomatoes and juices, onions, orange peel, reserved marinade. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, simmer (covered) for 1 hour.
5.  If you cannot use alcohol make a simple syrup and heat it and then steep some chopped raisins or dates in it for an hour or two, and then use some liquid from that instead of the brandy. That way you're adding some flavor, but without the alcohol. Much like the other suggestions, it won't be exactly the same as adding brandy or other liquor, though.
