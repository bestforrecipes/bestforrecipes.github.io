Make sure your legs aren't submerged in the water. You'll want them just above it. - - Steam legs for 5 to 7 minutes depending upon thickness. - - Turn off heat and leave legs in pot covered.

3.  Bring your broth \[with oriental flavor packets if using top ramen\] to a steady boil. - - If using Canton Noodles - add additional Siracha in place of Top Ramen noodle flavor packets.

5.  Picture of authentic Ramen Noodles. No seasoning packets included.
