##### Steps to make Mul (Water) Kimchi Instant Pickles:

3.  Combine all the vegetables you're going to pickle and apply salt. Mix together well and let it sit for a while until they begin to dehydrate.
4.  Once they have begun to dehydrate, apply the kombu kelp tea, red chili powder, sugar, and vinegar. Mix well and let it all blend together for 10-20 minutes.
5.  It's ok to use regular water, but since you can drink the pickling juice from the mul kimchi, it'll be even tastier if you use high quality water. Store in the refrigerator and add the water just before you eat it!
6.  Adding ice when you present it at the table can really improve the presentation. As for the chili pepper, you can also use small round slices, but in that case only use a small amount!
