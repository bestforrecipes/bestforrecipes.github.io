##### The ingredients needed to make Japanese-style Bread with Pollack Roe, Seaweed, Cheese, and Chikuwa:

1.  Prepare 200 grams ●Bread (strong) flour
2.  Prepare 100 grams ●Milk
3.  Make ready 40 grams ●Water
4.  Get 15 grams ●Sugar
5.  Make ready 15 grams ●Unsalted butter
6.  Prepare 3 grams ●Salt
7.  Get 3 grams Dry yeast
8.  Take 3 Chikuwa
9.  Make ready 3 slice Sliced cheese
10.  Make ready 1 Flavored nori seaweed
11.  Make ready 1 Green onion (minced)
12.  Make ready 2 tbsp ★Mayonnaise
13.  Take 50 grams~ ★Mentaiko

##### Steps to make Japanese-style Bread with Pollack Roe, Seaweed, Cheese, and Chikuwa:

1.  Let the bread machine make the bread dough. When it is done, form into a ball, lay seam side down, wrap with plastic wrap, then cover with a damp cloth, and let rest for 15 minutes.
2.  Cut the chikuwa lengthwise into 4 sections each. Combine the ★ ingredients.
3.  Roll the dough to 25 x 18 cm.
4.  As shown in the photo, spread the surface of the dough with the ★ ingredients, leaving 2 cm of an edge empty.

6.  Place seaweed on the area covered with mayonnaise. Place the sliced cheese on top of the seaweed. Then top with the chikuwa and green onion. Wrap it all up. (If arranged as in the photo to the right, wrap it from the left to the right)
7.  Since I love green onion, I used quite a lot. But the flavors from the other ingredients are quite strong, so it doesn't taste too astringent.
8.  Grease the baking pan. The dough sticks easily to the bottom, so line with parchment paper. (Just lining the bottom is fine).
9.  Tightly seal the seam. Cut into 5 slices and place on a baking pan. Let rise until doubled in size.
10.  Preheat the oven to 220°C, lower to 200°C and bake the dough for 10 minutes. Lower it again to 180°C and bake for another 10 minutes. If it seems like it will burn, cover with aluminum foil.
11.  You can also bake each slice separately in aluminum cups. For this, bake for 15 minutes at 180°C.
12.  This time, I didn't glaze with egg, but if you would like to do so, please go ahead.
13.  This time I used a long bread pan to bake the dough, but you can also use a round one♥ If you don't have a pan, you can bake each section separately, as demonstrated in Step 11.
