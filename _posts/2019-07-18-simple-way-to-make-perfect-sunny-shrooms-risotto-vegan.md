##### Instructions to make Sunny shrooms risotto (vegan):

1.  Heat the vegetable broth and set aside.
2.  Melt the spread and oil in a large skillet (or even better a paella pan if you have one) and cook the mushrooms for 3-5 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and set aside.
3.  Add the leek to the pan and saute until pale, stirring continuously. Next add the rice and cook until translucent.
4.  Pour in the wine and stir until it is all absorbed. Add the marjoram
5.  Add a ladle of the broth and continue cooking until absorbed. - Continue stirring and adding the broth a ladle at a time ensuring all the liquid is absorbed.

Top with vegan cheese, or add in some nutritional yeast for extra flavor, if desired. Since the star of this show is mushrooms, we use them in two ways. The first is to pulverize dried mushrooms into a powder (in the blender). It's a similar approach to what we use in our Creamy Vegan Ramen recipe, and it makes for the most savory, umami-packed stock. It might sound odd, but trust us: this method creates a much deeper, more mushroom-y flavor than what you'll find in store.
