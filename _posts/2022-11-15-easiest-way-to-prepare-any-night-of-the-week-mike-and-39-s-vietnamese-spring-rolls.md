##### Steps to make Mike's Vietnamese Spring Rolls:

1.  Chop all vegetable ingredients and chill in refrigerator until ready to assemble wraps.
2.  Dethaw shrimp and place in fridge until ready to assemble wraps.
3.  Boil Rice Vermicelli as per manufacturer directions minus one minute boil time.
4.  Strain water from Vermicelli but do not rinse.
5.  Add all ingredients in the Rice Vermicelli section to the base of the pot you boiled your Rice Vermicelli in.
6.  On a low heat, add Rice Vermicelli into those ingredients and gently stir until well mixed.
7.  Allow Vermicelli to cool down slightly.
8.  Authors Note: You also have the option of mixing Vermicelli and seasonings and all vegetables together for quicker and easier constriction. However, the layered technique \[shown above\] offers far more flavor and allows you to omit any vegetables certain guests may not find desirable.
9.  Heat a larger plastic bowl with 2" water in the microwave until hot.
10.  Place one Spring Roll Wrap in hot water for 13 to 18 seconds. 13 seconds works great for me. Be careful with these wet wraps since they can tear easily.
11.  Pull wrap out immediately and place evenly on a cutting board.
12.  Place Rice Vermicelli on the wrap and add each of your vegetables \[except shreadded cabbage or lettuce\] and shrimp. Don't pile it in too thick or your wrap won't roll properly.
13.  Gently but snugly fold the bottom half of the wrap upwards over the vegetables then fold the right and left sides inward.
14.  Gently but snugly roll up the rest of the wrap until sealed. Slightly wet down wrap with hands after it's sealed and place on a no stick surface or tinfoil.
15.  Repeat this process for all 12 wraps.
16.  Place all wraps on a serving plate covered with shreadded cabbage or lettuce. Repeat layer if stacking your wraps so they don't stick to one another.
17.  Chill well until ready to serve.
18.  Garnish wraps with leftover chopped vegetables and serve with soy sauce, a pre-fabed peanut sauce, a quality fish sauce and a spicy Thai Chili sauce! Siracha works great!
19.  Authors Note: You can serve these wraps either fresh or fried.
