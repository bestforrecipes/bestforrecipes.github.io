##### Steps to make Mike's Smokey Beef Meatballs For Subs:

1.  Add oil to a thick bottom pot. Chop all vegetables and add to heated pot. Sauté until vegetables are translucent. About 5 to 7 minutes.
2.  Add your seasonings and spaghetti sauces. At simmer, cook for ten minutes longer. Stir occasionally. De-thaw your 2 pounds meatballs in the microwave.
3.  In the meantime, butter and toast your hogies in oven at 350° for 5 minutes. Or, until browned and crispy. Add slices of Provolone Cheese to base of your warm toasted rolls. This will stop the bread from becoming soggy.
4.  Add your meatballs and simmer 15 minutes longer uncovered. Stir occasionally. You'll want your sauce to thicken up a bit.
5.  One of the best brands I've ever tasted!
6.  Cheeses required. Room temperature.
7.  Chilled pickled Pepperoncini and Jalapeño Peppers pictured.
8.  You can also serve these meatballs and sauce over noodles coated with garlic butter \[or olive oil\] once noodles are drained. It's a great way to keep your noodles fresh and toothy until served.
9.  Serve your piping hot halved meatballs with chilled sides on a separate dish. Also, with ice cold beers in frosty frozen mugs.
