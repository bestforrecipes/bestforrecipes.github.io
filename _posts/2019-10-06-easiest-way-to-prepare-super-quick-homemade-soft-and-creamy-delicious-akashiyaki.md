2.  Combine the batter ingredients, and mix with the cooled chicken stock. Beat the eggs well.
3.  The batter is done. If there are any lumps in the batter, pass it through a sieve to remove them. Lumps will make the akashiyaki taste like flour! The batter should be quite liquid.
4.  Cut the octopus into 1.5 cm pieces. Each piece should weigh about 4 g. They will shrink when cooked on the griddle so cut them rather big! The dashi from the octopus will also add flavor.
5.  Make the dipping sauce. Bring 500 ml of water to a boil, then lower the heat and add 30 g of bonito flakes. Simmer over low heat while skimming off any scum for about 10 minutes.
6.  After 10 minutes strain the dashi through a sieve. Squeeze out the bonito flakes well. Instead of throwing the used bonito flakes out, turn them into furikake (to sprinkle on rice etc)!. - - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/143961-make-it-with-dashi-bonito-tasty-bonito-furikake-rice-sprinkles](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/143961-make-it-with-dashi-bonito-tasty-bonito-furikake-rice-sprinkles)
