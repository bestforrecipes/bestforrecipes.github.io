1.  For the flavored ponzu sauce: Pour the mild vinegar over the dashi "tea bag" and the konbu seaweed.
2.  Add the soy sauce, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let it rest for a while at room temperature. Take the konbu and dashi bag out the next day, transfer to a storage jar and refrigerate.
3.  This flavored ponzu sauce is mild and goes with all kinds of food. When using it as a dipping sauce for hot pots, squeeze in a little citrus juice from any citrus in season, and it will smell wonderful.
4.  For the luxurious citrus juice ponzu sauce, put the dashi "tea bag" and konbu seaweed in a bowl.
5.  Squeeze the citrus juice of your choice, strain out the seeds and pulp, and pour it slowly into the bowl.
6.  Add the soy sauce and mirin, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let it rest for a while at room temperature. Take the konbu and dashi bag out the next day, transfer to a storage jar and refrigerate.
7.  Flavored ponzu sauce made with 100% citrus juice is really delicious. The mirin takes the edge off the sourness and saltiness of the other ingredients.
