2.  Coarsely chop some bamboo shoots and transfer both to a medium-sized bowl. Add finder chopped pork fat. Season with oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, white pepper, sesame oil, Shaoxing cooking wine and corn starch.
3.  To make the dumplings, apply oil to the back side of a knife. Use the backside of that knife to flatten the dough into a circle, with one side slightly thicker than the other. The thicker side will be the base of the filling. The other side will be the delicate pleated folds.
4.  If you are making dough from scratch; Here is the method how to make Har gow dough. In a bowl of a stand mixer, mix together plain flour, tapioca starch and salt. Then add boiling water a little at a time and knead until the dough comes together. Add oil until you get a soft ball that pulls cleanly away from the sides of the mixing bowl.
5.  Roll the dough into a thin log and cut out pieces of 10-12 g each. Keep the dough covered at all times to prevent drying.
6.  Here is the store bought one you can use but if you use store bought one you need some water to bind the both sides dough together. Place filling off-centre on the thicker base.

8.  Traditionally they make 13 (for lucky number) in the Chinese restaurant and I managed to do about 10.
