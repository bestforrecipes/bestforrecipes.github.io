Gochujang is a red chile paste that also contains glutinous rice, fermented soybeans, salt, and sometimes sweeteners. It's a thick, sticky condiment that's spicy and very concentrated and pungent in flavor. Heat levels can vary between brands, so check the packaging to see if it's labeled with any.

##### Steps to make Nanohana and Squid with Gochujang:

1.  Make the gochujang sauce. Combine the ☆ ingredients in the listed order. You can store it in the refrigerator for a few days.
2.  Cut 5 mm off the stem ends of the nanohana. Soak in lukewarm water for a while then drain. This makes them firm and crisp even after they are boiled.
3.  Bring plenty of water to a boil in a pot and add salt. Quickly blanch the peeled squid in the boiling water first and take it out to strain out the water. When it has cooled down, cut into 5 mm thick, 3-4 cm long pieces.
4.  Boil the nanohana in the Step 3 boiling water. Put the stem ends in first, then push the rest in and boil quickly. Strain and refresh in cold water immediately. Squeeze out excess water.
5.  Cut the Step 4 nanohana into 4 cm long pieces. Slice the thick parts of the stems in half lengthwise.
6.  Put the Step 3 squid and Step 5 nanohana in a bowl. Add some of the Step 1 gochujang sauce.

Home made Gochujang (Korean Chili Paste) is simply the best and making it is easier than you might think. In addition, I have also discovered that not all gochujang sold at stores are the same. Did you know that often a not-so-good gochujang has corn syrup, starch. Added more gochujang and a splash of fish sauce, more scallions, too. A twist on a traditional Mediterranean seafood stew that wowed our guests.
