Sea bass ceviche with avocado cream and spring onion fritters. by Matt Tebbutt. Ceviche (pronounced "seh-VEE-chay") is a Latin American recipe for raw fish and seafood marinated in citrus juice, mainly lime and lemon. The acid in the citrus denatures the proteins in the fish, causing it. Ceviche, also called cebiche or seviche, is one of the dishes that I enjoy having in summer, even I had tried ceviche in different regions of Mexico, and the basics always apply: Fish, onion, tomato.

##### Steps to make Ceviche:

1.  Rough chop shrimp into small pieces
2.  Place shrimp in square container. (Preferably a lasagna one)
3.  Squeeze lime juice over shrimp and let sit for about 30 mins. The lime will cook the shrimp.
4.  Small dice the tomato, cucumber, jalapeño, serrano and onion. Add the mix to the shrimp.
5.  Once shrimp has achieved a pinkish color, add salt and pepper to taste.
6.  You're ready to enjoy your ceviche. I prefer eating on a tostada with some ketchup and hot sauce. (try Salsa Huichol)
