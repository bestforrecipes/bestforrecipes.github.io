To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have vegan braised shiitake (vegetarian) using 7 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Vegan Braised Shiitake (Vegetarian):

1.  Take 10 pieces (dried weight: 60g) Dried Shiitake mushrooms
2.  Make ready 12 g Kombu
3.  Take 20 g Soybeans
4.  Prepare 8 cm (2 g) Kanpyo(dried gourd strip)
5.  Prepare 30 ml Mirin
6.  Prepare 30 ml Soy sauce
7.  Take 1 tsp Grain vinegar or black vinegar

It can also be kept in the refrigerator for a couple of days. I developed the recipe for the shiitake mushroom filling last summer after spotting frozen bao buns (that just happened to be vegan!) at an Asian market. And finally, prepare the shiitake mushroom filling. Slice the mushrooms nice and thin, so you can pile a bunch into your buns after they're cooked.

##### Steps to make Vegan Braised Shiitake (Vegetarian):

1.  Dry fry the soybeans (i.e., do not use oil) on low heat until they are light brown. Soak the kombu in water for around 30 minutes and slice it thinly with a kitchen knife.
2.  Soak the kombu and soybeans in water overnight. In a separate bowl, soak the dried Shiitake mushrooms in water overnight. (Remove the Shiitake stems during the soaking process so the rehydrated Shiitake will become plump.)
3.  Add water to the kombu/soybean Dashi until there is 300ml of liquid, and add 300ml of Shiitake dashi.
4.  Add the kanpyo to (3) and simmer it together with the kombu and soybeans for 2 minutes, removing the scum. Remove mixture from heat and let cool.
5.  Strain the liquid from (4) (300 ml) into a pot together with the Shiitake with their stems removed, and add mirin, soy sauce, and vinegar. Bring to a boil and remove the scum.
6.  Simmer on low heat for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Taste the soup and either return it to the heat to evaporate more liquid and concentrate the flavors or add soy sauce to taste.

I halved the recipe to use up some baby bok choy and shiitakes that I had on hand from another recipe. This of course decreased the liquid to the point that the extra time to reduce the sauce wasn't needed.
