##### Instructions to make Temari Sushi For Girl's Day Festival and Parties:

1.  Cook the rice in a rice cooker using 80% of the water you'd usually use. Leave to rest after cooking for 10 minutes, and mix with the sushi vinegar while still hot, rapidly cooling it by fanning it with a fan while you mix. Divide into 15 portions (each portion is about 40 g).
2.  While the rice cooks, make the other ingredients ready. Divide the cream cheese into 15 portions, the slice of lemon into 6 pieces, and cut the cherry tomatoes in half.
3.  Slice the avocado on half lengthwise, slice into 8 pieces and slice 3 of those into half (the ones to put inside the sushi). Dice the mango.
4.  Ham and mango sushi: Moisten a square piece of plastic wrap and put a slice of ham on top, with the nicer looking side facing outwards.
5.  Top with 2/3 of a portion of rice, and put a piece each of cream cheese and mango on top.
6.  Add the rest of the portion of sushi rice.
7.  Gather up the plastic wrap tightly and form into a ball.
8.  Decorate the top with tiny pieces of mango and fresh dill to finish. You can use pineapple instead of mango.
9.  Smoked salmon and salmon caviar sushi: Put a slice of smoked salmon on top of a moistened piece of plastic wrap in one direction, and put a shiso leaf with the back of the leaf facing upwards on top crosswise so that the leaf sticks out from each side of the salmon slice.
10.  Top with 2/3 of a portion of rice, and put a piece of cream cheese and a little salmon caviar on top of that. Add the rest of the portion of rice.
11.  Wrap tightly to form a round ball shape.
12.  Decorate with a bit of the lemon slice, salmon caviar and dill.
13.  Avocado and shrimp sushi: Put a slice of avocado and a shrimp on the plastic wrap, plus half a cherry tomato with the cut side facing up.
14.  Add 2/3rds of a portion of sushi rice, top with a portion of cream cheese and a small piece of avocado, then the rest of the portion of rice.
15.  Wrap tightly and form into a ball shape.
16.  Take off the wrap and it's done! This one falls apart more easily than the other types so be sure to wrap it tightly.
17.  Egg wrapped sushi (chakin style): Boil the shrimp and cut the snow peas diagonally. Cut a usuyaki tamago (thin omelette) in half and lay on a piece of plastic wrap.
18.  Put a portion of sushi rice that's already been formed into ball on top, wrap up the whole thing tightly and form into ball. Leave like this for a while.
19.  Decorate the top with snow peas, shrimp and salmon caviar to finish. You can put some filling into the rice if you like.
