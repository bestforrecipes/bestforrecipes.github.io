1.  You can marinate squid with some salt,pepper, red chilli and turmeric powders with lime in advance for anything more than 1 hour to overnight. If you do so, while cooking, reduce the spices accordingly. You can very well skip the step if you do not have time.
2.  Get all your chopping done. Rough chop onions,tomatoes and coriander leaves, slice chop ginger and garlic or just use some paste instead. Do not chop the french beans, just cut off the edges. Slit the green chillies.
3.  In a pan, heat the coconut oil, splutter the mustard and cumin seeds with curry leaves. Then keep on adding -going in first is ginger-garlic, and saute. Then goes in onions, saute them till color fades. Then, add in all the spices-saute well on low flame. Add in the tomatoes and coriander leaves, saute again. Now,add some water and bring it to boil.
4.  While this is getting done, pan sear with a splash of oil, the squid cubes and beans, till you see the colour fading the squid cubes begin to curl. Do not lower flame too much, the idea is to stir fry and not to completely cook.
5.  Add the stir fried squid and beans into the curry mix and cook for 2-3 minutes with the lid closed. Adjust for any salt and pepper if required and a sprinkle of sugar. Boil off all the excess water with lid open, splash a little more oil if you don't mind to get a slight 'beginning to char' effect. Finish off with dash of lime and serve hot.
