I like this dish a lot, because it's a delicious. Chirashi Sushi (Chirashizushi) is a kind of Sushi dish with thinly sliced Sashimi raw fish placed over a bed of Sushi Rice, instead of single pieces (Nigiri Sushi) or rolls (Maki Sushi). Chirashi Sushi is sometimes mixed up with Barazushi which doesn't contain much raw fish other than decoration. Chirashi Sushi, also called "Scattered Sushi" is a very popular at home, convenient way of eating Sushi.

##### Steps to make \[Farmhouse Recipe\] Chicken Chirashi Sushi:

1.  Scrub the dirt off the burdock root, and shave into thin small pieces. Remove the stems from the shiitake mushrooms and slice thinly. Shred the carrot.
2.  Cut the chicken into small bite sized pieces. Pour boiling water over the thin aburaage to remove the excess oil, cut in half and then cut into 7 mm strips.
3.  Put the \[A\] ingredients, burdock root, carrot and chicken in a pot and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the shiitake mushrooms and aburaage, and simmer until there is little liquid left in the pot. Let cool.
4.  Mix the kinshi tamago (shredded omelette) ingredients. Spread oil in a pan thinly and make very thin omelette (usuyaki tamago). Shred finely. Boil the green beans in salted water and slice thinly.
5.  Cook the rice using just a bit less water than usual with a piece of konbu seaweed. When the rice is cooked, remove the konbu seaweed.
6.  Mix the rice while it's still hot with sushi vinegar using a cut-and-fold motion and fanning with a handheld fan.
7.  Add the Step 3 ingredients and mix in. The key is to fan the rice to cool down rapidly, and to not mash the rice grains as you mix.
8.  Add the shredded omelette and green beans on top and it's done. Top with shredded nori seaweed just before eating.
9.  Homemade sushi vinegar: It's very handy to have this on hand.
10.  You can use this all-purpose soy sauce to make soba noodle sauce, mentsuyu noodle sauce, nametake (marinated enoki mushrooms), simmered dishes, egg rice bowls and so on in no time. - - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/145497-farmhouse-recipe-all-purpose-dashi-soy-sauce](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/145497-farmhouse-recipe-all-purpose-dashi-soy-sauce)
