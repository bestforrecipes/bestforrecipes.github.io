4.  Heat a frying pan and cook the okonmiyaki. Top the batter with pork slices. While the batter is still soft, tidy up the sides. Cook over low heat for about 5 minutes and then flip it over.
5.  After flipping, cook over low heat for another 8 minutes. Don't push down on the top of the okonomiyaki. While it's cooking, grate the yam.
6.  Flip over the okonomiyaki once more and cook for 2 minutes.
