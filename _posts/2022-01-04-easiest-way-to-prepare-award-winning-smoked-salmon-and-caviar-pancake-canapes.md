##### Instructions to make Smoked salmon and caviar pancake canapés:

1.  Beat the egg, then whisk in the flour, when that is smooth add the milk. It is easier to add 1/3 of the milk and whisk smooth then add the rest.
2.  Decant batter into a jug, then remember that you forgot to add the melted butter. So melt the butter in a crepe or non stick frying pan and add it to the batter. Put the batter in the fridge for 30 minutes or more to thicken slightly.
3.  Add a tiny amount of oil to the pan and wipe with kitchen paper, Start making pancakes / crepes. These need to be thin but not so thin that they cannot hold the smoked salmon filling. It's trial and error, the good news is any that don't work out are just lovely with some syrup.
4.  When your on a roll with your pancakes it should be easy, flip them with a pallet knife or toss them if you like. when both sides are golden stack them on a plate. When all done and cooled down you can cover and store in the fridge if your making them in advance.
5.  Slice the dill with a sharp knife, and beat it into the creme fraiche, if you want your pancakes to be easier to roll and handle you may prefer cream cheese which is firmer?
6.  Decide which side of the pancake you want to be the presentation side and sit that face down, then spread a couple of tsp of the dill cream mixture over it but not quite to the edges.
7.  Tear smoked salmon into small pieces and arrange them over the pancake, then if using fish roe (the jar I bought was about £5) spoon a small row towards the lower end closest to you.
8.  Lift up the edge closest to you and encase it over the caviar, then keep rolling it up like a cigar. Sit the pancake on some cling film and roll up.
9.  Twist the cling film at the ends to tighten it up and for extra security you can double wrap. Now store in the fridge until just a few minutes before you serve these canapés They will be fine for up to 24 hours before the pancakes start to get soggy.
10.  Unwrap the pancake then just trim of the ends with the sharpest knife you have, I cut mine into six pieces, so I started by slicing into 3 even sized peieces.
11.  Slice each 3rd on a diagonal but take care to leave at least 1/2 cm gap at the edge so that the pancake doesn't unravel. I arranged mine on a slate and topped with dill sprigs.
