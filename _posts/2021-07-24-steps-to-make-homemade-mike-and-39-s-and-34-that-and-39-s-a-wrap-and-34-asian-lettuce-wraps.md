1.  Medium heat fry all meat ingredients except for 1/4 cup fresh Cilantro, 1/4 teaspoon Chinese 5 Spice and 1/3 cup Beef Broth. Keep hamburger in larger chunks if possible. Be careful not to burn your garlic.
2.  Once hamburger is cooked, there should be no reason to drain any fat since you're using a 93% - 7% meat blend. This, "no drain," hamburger is also important since if you were to drain it, you'd loose the majority of your spices and smaller ingredients through your strainer.
3.  Frying at a higher heat, add 1/3 cup Beef Broth, 1/4 cup fresh Cilantro and 1/4 tsp Chinese 5 Spice, \[you can add more 5 spice if you enjoy a stronger flavor\] stir well and steam everything together with a tight fitting lid. Steam for approximately 5 minutes. You may need additional Beef Broth at the steam completion. You'll want a moist \[not dripping\] consistency to your meat mixture.
4.  After frying, plate up hamburger meat mixture in a serving bowl and set to the side.
5.  Chop all wrap filler vegetables, plate and chill.
