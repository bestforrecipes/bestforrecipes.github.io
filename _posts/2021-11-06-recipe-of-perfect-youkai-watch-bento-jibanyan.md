##### Instructions to make Youkai Watch Bento (Jibanyan):

1.  Trace Jibanyan's face on some kitchen parchment paper.

4.  Put the cut out drawing of Jibanyan on top of Step 3.
5.  Cut out the shape of Jibanyan's head.
6.  I forgot to cut out the one ear… But, if you're going to make the light part of the ear out of the crab stick, cut it out from the back.
7.  Cut out the light part of the ear. Keep the cheese there, just cut out the crab stick layer. If it's a pain, you can go ahead and just keep it intact and put the ear bits on top!
8.  For the light part of the ear, make a thin slice of the fish sausage (if you're using ham, but use the ham as-is) and cut out the ear pieces.
9.  If using the crab sticks for the ears, then take the pieces you cut out in Step 7, turn them upside down, and attach to the ears. Don't forget to make the cut in the ear! This one has crab stick on the right, fish sausage on the left.
10.  For the eyes, use cheddar cheese or thin omelet (or leftover tamagoyaki). For the pupils and mouth, use nori. For the scar, nose, and mouth, use the fish sausage.
11.  I used a cutter from the 100 yen shop for the eyes.
12.  Cut out the face part from the cheese.
13.  Top with the cheese and attach the face parts to finish. To make attaching the face parts easier, you can use some mayonnaise.
