##### Steps to make Salmon and Shrimp Pasta:

2.  Put the pasta in a saucepan of boiling water and keep at a vigorous simmer. Put the microwaved vegetables in a lidded saucepan at medium to high heat, add the peas or broccoli (drained) and then add the milk, cheese and herbs. Stir everything well to combine, bring to the boil and then turn down to a gentle simmer.. Add pepper to taste before putting the lid on the pan. Throughout this process add spoonful’s of water from the pasta pan to keep the pan moist.
3.  After the pasta has been cooking for 10 minutes test it and when it is nearly to your liking (but definitely do not undercook for this dish), stir the salmon and prawns through the sauce and vegetables and turn up the heat slightly until everything is warm, drain and add the pasta when al dente and gently mix in.
