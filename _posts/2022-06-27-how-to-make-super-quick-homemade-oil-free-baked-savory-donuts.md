11.  Get to taste vegetables (canned corn, cooked vegetables, etc), herbs (dried parsley, etc.) - the donuts will become doughy don't add too many vegetables

##### Steps to make Oil-free Baked Savory Donuts:

1.  Mix the batter ingredients together.
2.  Fill the donut molds evenly with cheese, vegetables, meat etc. Pour the batter in over them.
3.  Don't mix the vegetables etc. into the batter, or the batter will get too watery.
4.  Bake at 180°C for 15 minutes. Don't overbake these! Bake for a shorter time than regular baked donuts. Adjust the time depending on your oven.
5.  You can adjust the consistency of the batter with milk (or water). I've listed an average amount in the recipe, so if there are any issues please try adding more or less milk or water.
6.  Don't mix grated cheese into the batter - the donuts will become hard. It's best to sprinkle cheese into the bottom of the donut molds.
7.  The honey is indispensable for the texture of the batter. Don't reduce it too much.
8.  Slice the donuts in half and make raw vegetable sandwiches. The crispy texture is irresistible ♪ Apparently shops that sell cake salé (savory cakes) use their leftover cakes for vegetable sandwiches.
