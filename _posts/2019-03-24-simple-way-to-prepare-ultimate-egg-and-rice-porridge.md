##### The ingredients needed to make Egg and Rice Porridge:

3.  Take 1 roughly 2 pinches Bonito flakes
4.  Prepare 2 tsp Soy sauce
5.  Get 1 Egg

##### Instructions to make Egg and Rice Porridge:

1.  Simmer rice in enough water to soak. It's annoying to use a pot when you're just making a single serving, so I usually use a 20 cm frying pan.
2.  When the water is boiling, add the dashi stock granules. Simmer and reduce until the water just barely covers the surface.
3.  When the water is about half its original amount (as seen above), add bonito flakes and soy sauce and simmer a bit more. Adjust the amount of soy sauce to your liking.
4.  Add the egg. (At this point, I prefer the porridge slightly watery)
5.  Break up the egg…
6.  Turn off heat immediately and stir. The residual heat will thicken the egg.
