##### Instructions to make Crowd Pleasing California Rolls:

3.  Mix the imitation crab with mayonnaise, ketchup, salt and sugar. Peel the avocado and cut in pieces.
4.  Place the nori seaweed on plastic wrap and spread the sushi rice thinly. If the layer of the sushi rice is too thick, the roll will be too fat. It should be thin enough that the nori can be seen through it.
5.  Place the imitation crab and avocado below the middle line. Roll it up tightly while wrapping the filling with rice and adjusting the shape.
6.  If you look at it from the side, it will make a shape like a "6". Roll it all the way down to the end.
