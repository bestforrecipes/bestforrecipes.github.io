To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook grilled octopus using 8 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Grilled Octopus:

1.  Make ready 900 g octopus (baby, medium or large)
2.  Get Juice of one lemon (use less if preferred)
3.  Prepare Olive oil
4.  Take 3 garlic cloves, finely diced
5.  Make ready to taste Salt
6.  Make ready to taste Freshly ground black pepper
7.  Make ready 1/2 dried oregano (I used wild oregano)
8.  Get 1 bunch fresh chopped parsley

##### Instructions to make Grilled Octopus:

1.  I always boil the octopus first. I boil it anywhere between 45 minutes to 120 minutes depending on how soft I want the octopus to become. I asked the fishmonger to prepare the octopus for ease so it was literally just adding it to slightly salted water and allowing it to boil.
2.  Remove the octopus from the pot, rinse under cold water and allow to cool to room temperature for 30-60 minutes before grilling. While cooling drizzle some olive over the octopus and add the garlic to marinade.
3.  This is so much better on the barbecue but as its middle of winter here, I had to settle for a grill pan. So heat it up to medium/high heat, slice the tentacles to cook individually. Grill on each side for 3-5 minutes.
4.  Place in a bowl and drizzle the lemon juice, some more olive oil, parsley and oregano. Season with salt and pepper then gently toss the octopus in the sauce and serve.
