##### Instructions to make Crockpot taco soup:

1.  Dice the onions and mushrooms. Sautee in olive oil.
2.  Cut fat off boneless chicken breasts. Shred or cube the chicken as you saute it in a fry pan. Pour off the juices.
3.  Optional: blend corn to break up kernels. I have to do this for medical reasons. If your household has normal digestive function then use whole corn.
4.  Add canned ingredients to crockpot. Stir to thoroughly mix. (Note: if you use dried kidney beans then soak ~1-2 cups overnight. Drain and rinse).
5.  Add sauteed chicken, onions and mushrooms. Add water to cover ingredients and stir to mix.
6.  Add spices to taste. Start bland and gradually add salsa and chili powder. Optional: use a taco favoring packet if acceptable to the tastes of your household.
7.  Set crockpot to high and cook ~4 hours or until kidney beans are done. Add water if it becomes too thick.
8.  Heat one taco shell per person (follow directions on the box). Most will break it up to add to soup while others may use it as a "scoop".
9.  Garnish with shredded cheese (or a dollop of low fat sour cream mixed with a chopped green onion stem).
