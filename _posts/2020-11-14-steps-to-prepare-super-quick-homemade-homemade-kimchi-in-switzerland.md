##### Instructions to make Homemade Kimchi in Switzerland!:

2.  Using knife to make cross cut on the bottom of the cabbage.
3.  Tear them apart into quarter. Repeat the process.
4.  Cut the bottom stem.
5.  Chop them into little bigger than bite size.
6.  Put cabbage into big case or in my case cleaned sink. Sprinkle salt and give cabbage a masssage.
7.  Put all cabbage into a drain bowl or case to drain all the excess water from cabbage. Make sure you put something heavy on top to help drain over night.
8.  Cabbage : next day (most of the water was drained)
9.  Wash the cabbage throughly and squeeze. Leave the cabbage and help dry naturally.
10.  Prepare the kimchi glue. Put dried kombu into the water minimum 30 minutes to get bigger and softened.
11.  Once kombu is bigger and softened, put all into a pot and start heating with low heat. Stop the heat once it’s started to bubble. (I did too much)
12.  Mix rice flour or starch with water (not in the ingredients list).
13.  Pour the mix into the pot.
14.  Turn on the heat (low) and mix continuously until it becomes glue texture. Leave it aside.
15.  Start making kimchi paste.
16.  Chop daikon radish, carrot and chives/wild garlic into 10cm long stick.
17.  Sprinkle the salt (not in the ingredients list) and give it a massage. Leave them for minimum 30 mins to 1 hour to excess water.
18.  Grind ginger and chop the garlics.
19.  Add apple sauce. If you are using fresh whole apple, put ginger, garlic and apple into blender and make paste.
20.  Chop anchovies and add to the bowl.
21.  Add fish sauce, sesame oil / toasted sesame, and sugar.
22.  Mix all well.
23.  Prepare chili flakes. Pour chili flakes into the paste. (in my case it my bowl was too small so I sprinkle the rest of chili into veggies)
24.  Paste with chili, veggies with chili, and glue.
25.  Mix them all well. This is the yangnyoem aka kimchi paste.
26.  Mix the cabbage and yangnyeom.
27.  Start putting them in a jar.
28.  If you got left over yangnyoem, do not throw. Please keep in another jar or ziplock bag. You can use this yangnyoem to pickle other ingredients!
29.  Leave bottled kimchi in room temperature for a night. This will help kimchi fermentation.
30.  You can store them in a fridge. Also can enjoy after 2-3 days. Best starts after a week.
31.  Make sure you will open the jar everyday to let gas go. I usually open every morning and mix inside to let go the gasses.
