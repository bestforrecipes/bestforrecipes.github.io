2.  Now, add fish pieces and 100 ml water, in a pressure cooker or a deep bottom pan and let it cook for 20-25 minutes(for pressure cooker- 2 whistle).
3.  After this, remove the fish pieces onto a plate and let it cool down🌬. You will see the colour of fish is now white(means our fish is cooked!) So don't overcook it!
4.  After it cools down, remove skin & fishbones carefully….and shred off all the pieces. Then it will look this way👇🏻
5.  Take a plate (big enough to mix all the filling ingredients!) Add finely chopped ginger-garlic, finely chopped onions, mashed potatoes, finely chopped green chillies, lemon juice,shredded fish & all-purpose flour and mix gently.
6.  Now it's time to add the 'gem' 💎-our spices with the above mix.
7.  Add salt as required, then mix it all again but gently! Orelse you won't get that correct consistency of the filling & now keep the filling aside for 15 minutes. Believe me, this enhances it's flavors!
8.  Beat two eggs together in a bowl and keep it aside. Bring on the breadcrumbs.
9.  Add 2 medium cups oil in a deep bottom utensil for frying. If you want to do shallow frying then use 1/4 cup of oil in a nonstick pan, heat it🔥
10.  Bring the filling mix, beaten eggs, & breadcrumbs over the cooking station and do the following step for making each cutlets👇🏻 Roll the filling mix into desired shape (I made round), then dip in egg batter & then onto breadcrumbs! Go with patience dear…as we are very near to our delicious cutlets!!
11.  Rest these patties for 10 min and then fry or shallow fry the patties as desired, until these are golden brown & crispy on outside.
12.  Serve it hot with a tangy mint dip, ketchup, chilli mayo dip & don't forget to enjoy!
13.  Tips:- You can bake the patties for a healthier version (at 400 deg.F for 15 minutes or till coating is browned). - The oil must neither be too hot or not hot enough. If it is too hot, the cutlets will burn and if it is not hot enough, it has a tendency to absorb oil and turn soggy. Start with a hot pan of oil, then reduce the heat to medium and fry cutlets till evenly browned on both sides. Bring oil temperature up before dropping in the next batch of patties. - Enjoy cooking
