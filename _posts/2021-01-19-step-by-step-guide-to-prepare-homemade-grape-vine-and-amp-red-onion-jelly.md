##### The ingredients needed to make Grape Vine & Red Onion Jelly 🍇:

1.  Prepare Stage 1
2.  Get 1.5 kg tart green seeded grapes
3.  Prepare Stage 2
4.  Prepare 1 large red onion
5.  Make ready 1/2 cup sugar
6.  Prepare 6 crab apples or 1 dessert apple chopped with skin and seeds

##### Instructions to make Grape Vine & Red Onion Jelly 🍇:

1.  I used grapes and crab apples from my garden for this recipe. Homegrown and beautiful ❤️
2.  In a large saucepan add your grapes and start to heat them up. My grapes were frozen so I cooked them until they were nice and soft (about 15 mins).
3.  Use a masher to release the juices from the grapes. Then pass the grapes through either a Muslim cloth or a fine sieve.
4.  Discard the grape seeds and skins after you’ve got all the juice from them. Rinse the saucepan and add the juice back into it.
5.  Add the sugar and heat the juice until the sugar dissolves. Then add the onions.
6.  Now add your apples to the muslin cloth. If you have crab apples then chop into quarters. Crab apples have more pectin than regular apples. Make a parcel and dip the muslin into the simmering hot grape juice and sugar. We want the pectin to infuse while the grape juice bubbles away, this will help the jelly to set.
7.  Allow the mixture to bubble away, stir it occasionally and use a wooden spoon to mash the crab apples inside the muslin.
8.  Eventually the mix will start to thicken as the water evaporates off. Keep going until the mix coats the back of a spoon in thick syrup. Skim off any scum and transfer into a sterile jar. You should have enough for one jar.
