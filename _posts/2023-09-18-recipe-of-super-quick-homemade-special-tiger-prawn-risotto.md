##### Instructions to make Special Tiger-Prawn Risotto:

1.  Thaw prawns completely. Remove heads by twisting them off, drop them into a waiting large saucepan. Remove shells by putting fingers in the gap between the two sets of legs and pulling them off. Drop the shells in with the heads, into the pot.
2.  Using a sharp knife, make a shallow cut into the back of the prawns, and remove the string- like intestine, discard this. Put peeled prawns to one side.
3.  Slice and dice 1 Onion and add to the stock-pot. Peel and dice 2 small Carrots, add these to the pot. Put in 2-3 teaspoons of Black Peppercorns, and some Rock Salt.
4.  Cover with water, plus about 5 centimetres, bring to just boiling. Stir well and leave to simmer uncovered for at least 20-30 minutes. Leave to cool. Remove impurities, (the white frothy foam), with a spoon.
5.  Strain liquid through a colander to remove shells, heads and veggies. Then strain through a fine sieve to remove peppercorns and other bits. Leave to cool. Any liquid not used in the Risotto can be frozen, I suggest in small portions, to add to future soups and meals to enhance flavour.
6.  Once the stock is made, add the lemon-infused oil to a large Wok or saucepan. Add the Onions, diced, and the Risotto Rice. Heat for a few minutes until Rice and Onions until browned.
7.  Add 500 mls of Prawn Stock to the Wok, bit by bit and stir well. Add Prawns, Carrots, Peas, Sweetcorn, Peppers and about 2 teaspoons of minced Garlic. Stir well and bring to a simmer.
8.  Stirring occasionally, simmer until most of the liquid has been absorbed by the Rice. Taste broth and add Pepper and Salt to taste.
9.  Continue simmering, stirring gently, until all the liquid has been absorbed. Serve and enjoy!!

Peel the onion and garlic, trim the celery and finely chop all three. Place a large saucepan over a medium-low heat. Place the butter in the hot pan with the onion, garlic and celery, a splash of oil, and a splash of water.
