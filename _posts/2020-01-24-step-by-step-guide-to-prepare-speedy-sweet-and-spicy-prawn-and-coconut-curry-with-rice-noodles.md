##### Instructions to make Sweet and spicy prawn and coconut curry with rice noodles:

1.  Get your ingredients together (or at least your basics - I improvised and added a few as I went along)
2.  Put the spices in a pan with the oil, heat gently to release the flavours
3.  I used an oil with a California Reaper chile pepper cultivated by a friend. Adding herbs or dead hot chilli peppers to make flavoured olive oil really adds to the experience of cooking :-)
4.  After a couple of minutes, add the chopped onion, spring garlics and red chile pepper (seed it first)
5.  Stir well, add a slosh of white wine, cover and cook over a slow heat for about 7 minutes.
6.  Open the coconut milk tin. Usually however much you shake the tin before opening, there is a crust on top. Break it
7.  And stir well to mix the milk properly.
8.  Add 200 ml to the pan and heat.
9.  Cover and leave 10 minutes over a very low heat.
10.  It's a good time to do your poppadoms if you are going to make some. Also to start heating a pan full of water.
11.  Turn the heat off and extract the anise star and cardamoms.
12.  Blitz to make a sauce, return to the pan and add a gollup of creme fraiche (optional). Stir well.
13.  Put the rice noodles in the pan when the water is boiling. Turn the heat off and leave for four minutes.
14.  When the sauce starts bubbling, add the prawns and cook for a few minutes - careful not to leave for too long so they don't get tough. 3 minutes max. should be enough
15.  Put the poppadoms on a plate with some chutney. Rinse the rice noodles.
16.  Put the noodles in a bowl and the prawn curry on top. Serve like this if your child hates fresh coriander. If not, sprinkle with fresh coriander. And in both cases… Enjoy!!!
