##### The ingredients needed to make Yummy Salmon cakes:

##### Instructions to make Yummy Salmon cakes:

2.  Add the salmon to the pepper mixture, using a fork to break up large chunks.
3.  Add the egg, then the spices, stir well - then add the bread crumbs. The texture should be wet, but stable enough to form a cake/burger that doesn't fall apart. Make them as big or small as you like, shapes are fun for kids!! \*Add bread crumbs to thicken, water to moisten.
