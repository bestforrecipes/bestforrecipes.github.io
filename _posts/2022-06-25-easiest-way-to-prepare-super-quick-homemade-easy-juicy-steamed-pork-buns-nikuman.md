2.  When it forms a ball, knead on a clean surface. Knead or fold gently several times, taking care not to rip the dough. Repeat until the surface of the dough is smooth, about 15 minutes.
3.  Cover with a moistened and wrung out kitchen towel, and leave to rest in a warm place for 30 minutes to an hour.
4.  Make the filling. Dissolve the Chinese soup stock in 50 ml of boiling water. Add the gelatin and let it absorb the water. Microwave and dissolve the gelatin. Chill and harden the jelly in the refrigerator.
5.  Roughly chop the bamboo shoots, rehydrated shiitake mushrooms and leeks. Finely chop the ginger. Combine the chopped up ingredients and the ground pork until the meat is sticky. Add the seasoning ingredients.
6.  Add the jelly from Step 4 to the meat filling and mix. Add the katakuriko and mix well.
7.  Divide the meat filling into 8 portions and roll into balls.
8.  Divide the rested dough into 8 portions, and roll each one gently into a ball. Cover with a moistened kitchen towel and let rest for 15 minutes.
9.  To form the buns: Roll each dough into a 10 cm circle. Thin out the edges, until the circle is 12 cm. If the rolled out dough shrinks back, cover with a moistened kitchen towel again and let it rest for a bit.
10.  Center a meat filling on the dough circle, and add 2 shrimps on top. Wrap the filling.
11.  Make little pleats as you wrap. If this is difficult for you, close up the bun and turn it over so you have the smooth side on top.
