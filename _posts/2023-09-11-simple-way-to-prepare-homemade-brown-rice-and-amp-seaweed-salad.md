To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook brown rice & seaweed salad using 13 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Brown Rice & Seaweed Salad:

1.  Get brown/wild rice (I used barley and millet)
2.  Make ready water
3.  Make ready pumpkin seeds
4.  Get soy sauce
5.  Prepare spring onions
6.  Get finely sliced pickled sushi ginger or grated fresh ginger
7.  Get mirin or lemon juice

9.  Take oil
10.  Make ready soy sauce,

The process that produces brown rice removes only the outermost layer, the hull, of the rice kernel and is the least damaging to its nutritional value. The complete milling and polishing that converts. Slow and low is the way to go. Yes, it takes a little longer than white rice, but it's not any harder.

3.  Cook your peas
4.  Combine the mirin or lemon juice, sesame oil, and soy sauce, spring onion
5.  Stir all the ingredients into the rice and half the pumpkin seeds. Transfer to a serving dish.

Is brown rice or white rice better for health? If you've ever cooked brown rice that turned out gummy, undercooked, or stuck to the bottom of the pan, join the club.
