2.  To assemble the wontons, place wrappers on a work surface (I usually do 3 at a time). Keep remaining wrappers under a slightly damp cloth, they dry out quickly. Spoon appx 1 tsp of the shrimp mixture on to the center of the wrappers. Using your finger, rub the edge of the wrappers with water. Fold the dough over the filling to creat a triangle, pinch the edges to seal, set aside.
3.  Heat 1 tbls sesame oil in a large stock pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger, and cook stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.
4.  Whisk in chicken broth, mushrooms and 2 cups water.
5.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer till mushrooms have softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in greens and/or bok choy, and green onions. Stir in miso paste until well combined, about 1-2 minutes.
6.  Stir I wontons until cooked through, appx 2-3 minutes
7.  Enjoy

Since this is a shrimp wonton soup I like to simmer the broth along with the shrimp shells for a few minutes to get even more shrimp flavour into the soup and throwing in some lemongrass and ginger. Wontons are mostly made up of fresh shrimp. The delicately seasoned filling is then wrapped in Wonton Soup and dumplings have always been an obsessed favorite of mine since I was a young. Use shrimp shells to prepare the wonton soup. The soup at the legendary Mak's Noodles in Hong Kong includes unusual ingredients such as dried flounder and dried shrimp.
