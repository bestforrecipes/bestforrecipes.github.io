##### Instructions to make Skillet Shrimp Fajitas:

1.  Mix together all of your seasoning and using half of the mix, season your shrimp and set aside
2.  While shrimp is kickin' it with the seasoning, slice up all your veg.
3.  In a skillet, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil and cook your shrimp on medium-high heat until cooked, remove from pan and set aside
4.  Add onions to the skillet and cook for 3-5 min. (We're adding the onions first because we want them to be soft but still have a bite to them, but we definitely want the veg to retain its crunch/bite and freshness.
5.  Add your peppers to the pan and mix together with onions, add the remaining seasoning to the pan. Cook until peppers are done to your liking (again, I prefer crisp, but you do you)- this is supposed to be simple afterall
6.  Add your shrimp back to the pan, mix and squeeze the juice of 1 lime over everything and DONE! Enjoy!

Pat shrimp and veggies dry before cooking. Serve with guacamole, sour cream, salsa or cheese. Skillet Shrimp Fajitas are super easy to put together and bursting with flavour.
