5.  Add sauteed chicken, onions and mushrooms. Add water to cover ingredients and stir to mix.

7.  Set crockpot to high and cook ~4 hours or until kidney beans are done. Add water if it becomes too thick.
8.  Heat one taco shell per person (follow directions on the box). Most will break it up to add to soup while others may use it as a "scoop".
