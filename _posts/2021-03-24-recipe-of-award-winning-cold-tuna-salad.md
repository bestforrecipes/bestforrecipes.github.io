3.  In large bowl combine mayo, tuna, onion salt/powder and gently stir together. Taste mixture; it should taste oniony and a little bit too salty. If not add small amounts of the onion salt until it does. You will be adding the rings and eggs so don't worry about it being too salty.
4.  Add chopped celery and mix together. Add half of the rings and gently fold wet mixture and celery into rings. When they are combined add rest of rings and gently mix in.
5.  Cut hard boiled eggs into small pieces and carefully fold into pasta mixture. Taste and add mayo and/or more seasoning.
