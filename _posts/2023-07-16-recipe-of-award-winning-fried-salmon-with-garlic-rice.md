Personally, I don't eat salmon skin unless the salmon is deep-fried and the salmon skin becomes crispy. For easy cooking, there is no need to. When it comes to fried rice, anything goes â€” leftover meat or fish, or whatever stray vegetables are lurking in your produce drawer or freezer will do. Gently fold in the reserved salmon and serve immediately. Top with remaining scallion greens and serve with hot sauce or chile-garlic sauce, if.
