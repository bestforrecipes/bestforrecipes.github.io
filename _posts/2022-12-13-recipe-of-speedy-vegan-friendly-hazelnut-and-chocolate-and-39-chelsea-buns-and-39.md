##### Steps to make Vegan Friendly Hazelnut and Chocolate 'Chelsea Buns':

1.  Put water, yeast and sugar in a bowl and leave for about 10 minutes or until frothy.
2.  Add melted spread and soy milk, mix.
3.  Add 3 cups of flour and stir until it forms a ball. It'll get pretty hard to mix but hang in there. Leave the other 1/2 cup of flour.
4.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (springs back when you pull it).
5.  Place in a lightly oiled bowl and leave to rise in a warm place for an hour or so, until it's at least doubled in size.
6.  Preheat oven to 190°C. Take out of bowl and knead lightly on lightly floured surface. Roll out into about a 30cm X 25 cm rectangle.
7.  Combine all filling ingredients and spread out on the rectangle, making sure it reaches the edges.
8.  Roll from the shortest side into a log. Cut into 12 pieces with a sharp knife.
9.  Stuff into a sponge tin and bake for about 25 minutes.
10.  While waiting, whip up the icing by combining all ingredients. It should be a little runny.
11.  Also while waiting combine the glaze ingredients in a saucepan on the stove until the sugar is dissolved. Strain the jelly-like pieces with a sieve.
12.  When out of the oven, brush with glaze, it will give a much more shiny appearance.
13.  Lastly, when the buns are cool, drizzle with icing.

I followed buddyglb's advice and swapped out I used buddyglb's adjustments and my chelsea buns turned out looking absolutely fabulous! I now make them on a steady basis (weekly) as many. Nothing beats a warm, sticky Chelsea bun fresh from the oven. These are drizzled with icing for an extra naughty treat.
