2.  Dislodge clams from shell and put back into place. Reserve any fluids if you possibly can.
3.  If incorporating the fresh veggies, fry in butter until translucent. About 3 minutes for fine minced. Then add stuffing. My students opted for both versions.
4.  Pack stuffing tightly and generously on your raw giant clams. Grill for 7 minutes covered at 400°. Or, until they're bubbling. Add cheeses at the finish and allow to melt.
5.  Serve these delicious appetizers with hot sauces to the side. Garnish with fresh parsley. Enjoy!
