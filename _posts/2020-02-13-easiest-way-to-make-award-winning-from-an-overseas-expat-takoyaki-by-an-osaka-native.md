##### Instructions to make From an Overseas Expat: Takoyaki by an Osaka Native:

1.  Sift the ☆ ingredients together. (If you don't have cake flour in your region, use pastry flour.)
2.  Break the eggs into a bowl and beat them.
3.  Add dashi stock granules to the eggs. Add water little by little while whisking.
4.  Put sifted flour into the egg mixture, and stir until there are no lumps.
5.  Cover the bowl of batter with plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator. In the meantime, get the fillings ready.
6.  When everything is ready, switch on the takoyaki maker to heat it up. Don't forget to plug it in first!
7.  When the takoyaki maker has heated properly, oil it generously. Use plenty of oil to make the outsides crispy!!
8.  Pour in batter to fill about 80 to 90% full. Put a piece of octopus (or other filling) into each hole. The flour tends to sink to the bottom of the batter, so give it a little stir each time you pour it in.
9.  Add enough batter to the takoyaki pan to hide the surface completely, and add tenkasu (tempura batter crumbs), green onion, and red ginger.
10.  When the outsides of the batter in the indentations come up as shown, it's time to flip them over!
11.  It looks like this when you flip the balls. It looks like a mess, but don't worry.
12.  Flip the balls repeatedly while tucking the raggedy pieces under them. The balls will become rounder and rounder. Add some oil if needed.
13.  When the balls are done, pour on the toppings of your choice and enjoy!
14.  Since I live overseas, it's difficult for me to get a hold of octopus. So I substitute it with squid or shrimp. I make my own tenkasu, and blend my own sauce.
