##### Instructions to make Srilankan crab curry # surf:

1.  Put the crabs in the freezer for 1 hour to immobilise them. Pull off the top shells, pull out the spongy grey gills and remove the guts. Wash clean and put the crab in boiling water along with little salt snd turmeric powder (I do this to remove the raw smell and firm up the flesh) 5 minutes.. Remove, chop the crab into 6 pieces..
2.  For the curry powderPlace the rice on a dry non-stick pan. Heat over medium heat until the rice starts to turn light brown. - Add the rest of the spices and pan roast for a further 3 - 5 minutes until the spices start to brown, toast and become aromatic. Keep moving the pan to prevent the spices from burning. - Remove from the heat and let the spices cool. - Once the spices cool down - use a spice grinder (or a mortar and pestle) to grind the spice mix into a powder in batches and mix well. Store
3.  Heat the oil in a large heavy-based saucepan, add the onions, curry leaves, chillies and cook for a few minutes or until the onions are golden
4.  Add the coconut paste.. saute' - Add the curry powder, chilli powder and turmeric mix in and add the crab and cook for another 3 minutes, at this stage you need to stir it a lot so the spices don’t burn.
