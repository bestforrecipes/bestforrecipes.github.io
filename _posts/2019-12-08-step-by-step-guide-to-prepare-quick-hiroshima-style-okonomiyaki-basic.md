##### Steps to make Hiroshima-style Okonomiyaki (Basic):

1.  Prepare all the ingredients.
2.  Here are the ingredients used in this recipe. From the left: - Kelp dashi powder, dried kelp (Ground kelp can be used as a substitute of kelp dashi powder), tenkasu, mirin, Otafuku Okonomi Sauce or Otafuku Gluten free Okonomi Sauce (your choice of the sauce), Kewpie mayonnaise, aonori, and dried bonito.
3.  To prepare the batter, mix flour, water, mirin, dashi and salt. Rest the mixture in the fridge for at least 2 hours so that all the ingredients come together. If time allows, rest it overnight. The batter will become well-blended to make a thin crepe easily. If there is no time, it's OK to use immediately, but it won't be as good.
4.  Cut the cabbage in quarters and remove the core. Place the core side down, and shred the cabbage starting from the top in abjout 1/8" wide strips. The width is all up to you.
5.  Heat the electric griddle to 350F. Grease the griddle slightly using a paper towel. Making a thin crepe will be difficult if too much oil is added onto the griddle because a crepe will easily slide off the griddle.
6.  Scoop a little less than 1/4 cup of batter, and drop it onto one side of the griddle. To make a thin crepe, spread the batter using five concentrate circles starting from the center and moving out. Do not go over the same area more than once and avoid leaving gaps in within the crepe.
7.  Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon fish meal, 1/4 teaspoon kelp powder and 1/4 tablespoon chopped green onion onto each crepe.
8.  Once the crepes look dry (in 10-20 seconds after spreading the batter), place one big handful of shredded cabbage and 1/2 handful of bean spouts onto each crepe.
9.  Add tenkasu onto the bean sprouts. Grill the bacon aside.
10.  With grilled side down, add bacon on top. Drop a tablespoon of batter onto the pile evenly so all ingredient come together. From the beginning to now, it should take 2 minutes.
11.  Put the egg noodle on the grease left from the previously cooked bacon. - Add the water mixture to moisten it, and add flavor with a table spoon of Okonomi sauce. Adjust the noddle's shape so it is a circular shape slightly smaller than the crepe. Cook the pile and the flavored egg noodles for 2 minutes.
12.  Once the edge of crepe looks dried and slightly lifted, flip the pile upside down. Raise the temperature of the griddle to 390F, and cook about 30 seconds. Bring the scattered cabbages under the crepe nicely with the spatula.
13.  Lower the temperature of griddle to 350F. - Press down the pile with the spatula to remove the excess moisture. - Lift the pile up, rotate it and put it down for a couple of times. In this way, the cabbage is evenly steamed. - If the quality of cabbage looks dried, inject 1 tablespoon of the water mixture under the crepe using a tube. Cook for 5 minutes.
14.  Place the crepe pile onto the noodle. Cook for 1 minute.
15.  Crack an egg onto the griddle, and spread it in a round shape. Place the pile onto the egg spread, and cook for 30 seconds. - Flip the whole pile downside up (egg side up).
16.  Add Okonomi sauce, mayonnaise, and aonori. Bonito and pickled ginger is optional.
