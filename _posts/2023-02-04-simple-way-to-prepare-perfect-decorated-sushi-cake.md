3.  Pour the Sushi Vinegar over the HOT rice, then empty it into a large mixing bowl. Mix it well gently and thoroughly, fanning the rice with a fan or piece of cardboard to help the rice cool quickly. Cover the rice with a damp cloth to stop the rice drying out.
4.  While Rice is cooking and cooling down, prepare other ingredients for Topping and Filling.
5.  Line a round cake tin (I used 21cm tin) with plastic food wrap. Fill it with 1/2 Sushi Rice evenly and press down. Arrange Filling ingredients on the rice, cover with remaining 1/2 Sushi Rice, and press down.
6.  Place a serving plate on the tin, and flip it over to transfer the Sushi Cake onto the plate. Remove the food wrap.
