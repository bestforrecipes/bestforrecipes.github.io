2.  Next open can of tuna and pour all the fishy water out the can wash out the tuna, (so you won't taste tuna flavor) season it with salt and pepper put it in the pot to heat up a bit with the noodles. Add swiss cheese to the noodles and stir until it has melted (the crush red peppers should still be in the pot even after water is poured out). Add the chicken flavor seasoning to noodles while a little water is still in the pot just enough for the noodles to be hydrated and moist not a lot you don't want you noodles to taste like soup. (This prevent noodles from being too salty and from burning on the heated stove).
