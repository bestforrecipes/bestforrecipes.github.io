I wait all year, dreaming of the simplest, most. An heirloom tomato (also called heritage tomato in the UK) is an open-pollinated, non-hybrid heirloom cultivar of tomato. They are classified as: family heirlooms, commercial heirlooms. Gazpacho is the chilled, tomato-based raw soup that originated in Andalusia Today, gazpacho is best known as a cold tomato soup, but good gazpacho is much, much more than throwing a can of.

##### Instructions to make Heirloom Tomato Poke:

1.  Combine the first 6 ingredients.
2.  Cut up the tomatoes. I like big, non-uniform chunks of tomato for this dish.
3.  Toss the soy mixture with the tomatoes.
4.  Toast the nori. You can do this by waving a sheet of nori over a heat source until you feel it stiffen. It's quite noticeable when it sort of dries up and turns a bit crispy. Toasting just improves the texture and flavor of the nori.
5.  Now, take your 2 sheets of toasted nori back to back and fold them like a hot dog bun. Repeat this so that you have a long strip of nori. Since it's toasted, it should break at the folds, so you'll have 8 strips of nori in a stack. Grab some kitchen scissors. holding the nori over the tomatoes, cut about 2mm off of the end of the short side. Keep doing this until the nori is all turned into these little thin strips. You can kinda see what it's supposed to look like in the picture.
6.  Time to serve. But don't forget to check the flavor and see if it needs any small adjustments.
