##### Instructions to make Butterscoth mousse cake:

1.  Whip the cream to form stiff peaks and keep it refrigerated until required.
2.  Heat up the milk. Reserve 1/4 cup of the milk and mix cornstarch in it. Set aside.
3.  In a clean pan, add the sugar and water and bring it to a gentle boil. Let the mixture keep boiling for 5-6 minutes. You’ll start to see that it starts turning a deep brown colour. DO NOT STIR. Just let the mixture cook on medium-low heat.
4.  Once the water has almost evaporated, add the butter and swirl the pan around.
5.  Once the butter has melted, add the milk/cream and mix well. At this point, you can stir to incorporate everything well.
6.  Add the cornstarch paste to the mixture and keep stirring constantly. In about 3-4 minutes, the mixture will start to thicken. Keep cooking till it has reached a thick sauce like consistency and coats the back of a wooden spoon
7.  Meanwhile – Add the agar-agar solution to the mixture and mix well. Let the mixture cook for 3-4 minutes while stirring constantly. Switch of the flame.
8.  As the mixture cools, keep stirring. This will prevent a skin from forming on top. Once the mixture is cool, add the vanilla/butterscotch extract and mix well.
9.  Pass the mixture through a sieve to get a smooth, lump-free mixture.
10.  Add the cooled mixture to the previously whipped cream. Gently fold the mixture into the cream.
11.  Divide the mixture equally between serving glasses. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until it has set. (It could take about 3-4 hours)
12.  Garnish with chocolate chips or butterscotch chips, or chopped nuts & serve.
