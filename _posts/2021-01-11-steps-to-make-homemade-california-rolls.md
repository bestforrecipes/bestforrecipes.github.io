##### Steps to make California Rolls:

2.  Once the rice is cooked, lightly mix it in the rice cooker and mix in the sushi vinegar while it is still warm.
3.  Mix the rice with a slicing motion, being sure not to crush the grains. Use a fan to dispel the steam and bring out the luster of the rice.
4.  Peel the avocado, remove the pit, and slice lengthwise into 8 slices.
5.  Cut the nori sheets in half.

8.  Using a moistened knife, slice into 6 pieces. Don't press down, pull the knife back toward you in a sawing motion as you slice. Its easier to cut if you use a good sharp knife and moisten it slightly. However, I used a moist serrated knife, like the kind you use to slice bread. It slices cleanly.
