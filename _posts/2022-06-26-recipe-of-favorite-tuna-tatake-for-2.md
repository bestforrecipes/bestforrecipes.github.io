2.  Boil sake (or substitute) and Mirin for about 10 seconds for the evaporation of the alcohol. Put soy sauce and reduce over low heat to thicken it a little bit (the dressing would stay on the tuna better. Do not leave it unattended). Turn off heat and add lemon zest.

4.  Slice tuna into 1/4 inch pieces. Arrange tuna in circular on a plate.
5.  For garnish: use only the white part of a green onion, the longer the better. Make an incision to the side of the onion, peel a few layers, julienne the onion, put in ice cold water with some radish sprouts.
6.  Drizzle the dressing on tuna.
7.  Put some of the crisp onion and radish sprouts in the center of the tuna for garnish.
