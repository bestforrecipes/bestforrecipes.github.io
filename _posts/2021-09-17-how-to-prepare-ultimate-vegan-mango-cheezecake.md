##### Steps to make Vegan mango cheezecake:

1.  Blitz the ginger biscuits into crumbs, melt the butter & mix into the biscuit crumbs. Press into the greased cake-tin to make a base. Bake for 15mins on 180 \*C. Then leave to cool.
2.  Blend the tofu, soft cheese, icing sugar, 150g of mango chunks & plum paste till smooth. Taste & add more plum paste if needed -you’re aiming for a sour cheesy flavour.
3.  Once you know the base is cool (1/2 hr after baking) put 100ml of the mango juice & the water in a small pan & mix in the Agar Agar powder. Bring to the boil, stirring constantly- let it boil for a minute (keep stirring)
4.  Working quickly because it will start to set as it cools- switch on the blender & pour in the Agar Agar mix, blend for a minute then scrape the contents into the cake tin, on top of the biscuit base. Spread out evenly -leave to set in the fridge for a couple of hours.
5.  To finish - purée the rest of the mango pieces with a blender or mash with a potato masher, add a squeeze of lemon juice & a bit of icing sugar if it needs pepping up a bit, tinned can lack flavour.
6.  Take the cheezecake out of the fridge. It should be set firm. Press a shaped cookie cutter into the centre gently (I used a star). Scrape the filling out of the middle of the shape. Fill the gap with mango purée & remove the cutter. Then decorate with edible glitter or edible flowers -whatever you like!
