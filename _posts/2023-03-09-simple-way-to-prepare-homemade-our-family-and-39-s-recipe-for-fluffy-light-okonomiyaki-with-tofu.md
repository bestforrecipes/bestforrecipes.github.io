4.  Put 1 serving (about 80g) of the batter into a small bowl with about 120 g of chopped cabbage, a little tenkasu, green onion, and red pickled ginger. It will taste better if you have more cabbage than batter.
5.  Mix with a spoon to incorporate air into the batter. Do this one pancake serving at a time.
6.  The key to a soft, airy fluffy okonomiyaki is to mix up the batter and vegetable while incorporating air just before cooking.
7.  Pour the batter onto the electric griddle. Use the edge of the spoon to gently spread the pancake out so that it's about 2 cm thick. Cook for about 3 minutes.

10.  After about 4 minutes, flip the pancake over again and cook for another 3 minutes or so.
11.  Put on okonomiyaki sauce, ao-nori seaweed powder, and bonito flakes, and it's done.
