6.  Take 1 large shallot clove; diced
7.  Make ready 2 tbsp parmigiano reggiano or similar hard white italian cheese
8.  Take salt & pepper, to taste

##### Steps to make Easy Gluten Free Garlic Shrimp Pasta:

1.  If your shrimp is frozen, take them out of the freezer to thaw and put them in room temperature water. This will help them thaw faster.
2.  Bring a pot of water to a boil, salt, add olive oil, add pasta. cook according to package directions.
3.  in a large saucepan, melt the ghee or butter on medium heat, about 1 minute.
4.  add diced shallots to melted ghee, cook until semi-translucent, about 3-5 minutes. (NOTE: DO NOT add the garlic with the shallots, the garlic will burn before the shallots cook through.)
5.  when shallots are semi-translucent, add the garlic. cook for another 2-3 minutes and reduce temperature to med-low heat.
6.  Add shrimp. If raw, sauté until they turn pink through-out, about 3-4 minutes on each side. If precooked, sauté for 5 minutes so the flavors can coat the shrimp, but not too long so the meat doesn't toughen.
7.  drain the pasta, transfer to a medium tupperware container with a lid or large mixing bowl
8.  toss the contents of the saucepan, pasta, cheese, and salt & pepper, together.
9.  Open container and enjoy. Add more cheese if so desired. (I use A LOT!)
