4.  At the same time, bake your bread as per manufactures directions \[usually 7 to 10 minutes at 400°\] then cover bread with a towel until you're ready to slice and serve.
5.  Once roasted - using forks or a potato masher - mash garlic mixture well. Taste test to see if you'd like to add additional herbs or salt. If you feel it's too salty - no worries. Just add additional sun dried tomatoes.
