##### The ingredients needed to make Shiitake Mushrooms Stuffed with Crabsticks:

6.  Take 1 tbsp Mayonnaise
7.  Get 6 Shiitake mushrooms
8.  Get 1 Katakuriko

##### Steps to make Shiitake Mushrooms Stuffed with Crabsticks:

1.  Cut the crab sticks into small pieces.
2.  Mix the chopped onion and cake flour in the side of a bowl, Mix the crab sticks, mayonnaise and grated garlic (optional) in another part of the bowl. Then bring everything together and knead together.
3.  Form into 6 balls.
4.  Take the stems off the shiitake mushrooms.
5.  Coat the insides of the shiitake mushrooms with katakuriko.
6.  Stuff the mushroom caps with the balls from Step 3, and dust the fillings with katakuriko. If you are adding the toppings later, make a dent in the middle of the stuffing.
7.  Spread oil in a heated pan, and pan fry the mushrooms with the filling side down.
8.  When they are nicely browned, turn the mushrooms over, cover with a lid and cook over low heat.
9.  When they are cooked through they're done. Put a little cheese in the dents in the fillings, put the lid back on and let the cheese melt with the residual hat.
10.  Add toppings such as edamame.
11.  The photo here shows little balls made with 40 g of crab sticks and 1 teaspoon of aonori. These aren't stuffed into shiitake mushrooms. For the recipe I used 80 g of crab sticks.
12.  When coating the tops of the fillings with katakuriko, put the potato starch in a small cup, invert the filled mushroom cap into the cup and press down. This way the katakuriko won't go flying all over and it's easier.
