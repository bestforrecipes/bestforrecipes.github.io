##### The ingredients needed to make Asian-style Spaghetti Aglio e Olio with Coriander:

1.  Get 100 grams Pasta (I used linguine)
2.  Get 40 ml Extra virgin olive oil
3.  Get 1 to 2 cloves A. Garlic (chopped roughly)
4.  Prepare 1 A. Red chili pepper (sliced)
5.  Make ready 1 A. Prawns (peeled and deveined)
6.  Get 1 Coriander
7.  Get 40 ml White wine
8.  Take 2 1/2 ml Thai fish sauce
9.  Take 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon Plain flour
10.  Take 1 Salt and pepper
11.  Get 1 Black pepper (optional)
12.  Get 1 Lemon juice (optional)

##### Steps to make Asian-style Spaghetti Aglio e Olio with Coriander:

1.  Prepare the A ingredients as instructed above.
2.  Chop the stems of the coriander finely and cut the leafy parts roughly. Omit the coriander if you don't like it.
3.  Put the plain flour in a measuring cup.
4.  Pour 3 L of water into a large pot and bring to a boil. Just before it comes to a boil add 2 tablespoons of salt (it should come to 1% of the entire pot of water).
5.  The amount of salt in the pasta cooking water is important to the resultant dish so measure precisely. When the water comes to the a turn the heat to low and leave to stand.
6.  Put the olive oil, garlic and sliced red chili pepper in a cold frying pan. Heat over a low heat slowly until fragrant.
7.  Once the garlic turns golden brown and fragrant add the prawns. Salt and pepper.
8.  Turn the heat to medium-low and add the white wine and fish sauce. Cover with a lid quickly and steam the prawns.
9.  Meanwhile add the pasta to the water from Step 4 and cook until al dente. Drain the pasta 30 seconds to 1 minute earlier than the package instruction says. Cook the pasta over a low heat.
10.  After the prawns have cooked through add coriander stems from Step 2. Stir quickly.
11.  Add 50 ml of the water you used to cook the pasta to Step 3. Add this to Step 10's pan and cook over a medium heat for 15 seconds to emulsify the sauce.
12.  \[Note\] Emulsifying the sauce is important. At home you cook a small amount of pasta so you cannot get enough starch to emulsify the sauce.
13.  By adding the flour the resultant sauce will have the right consistency. You will have a restaurant-quality sauce at home.
14.  Turn the heat to low-high and add the drained pasta. Stir well.
15.  I like it as it is but add more rock salt (not listed in the ingredients) if necessary.
16.  Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with coriander leaves. Sprinkle with lemon juice and black pepper to your liking.
17.  Prawns sautéed in white wine and fish sauce really give this dish an exquisite taste. And combined with the coriander stalks just further adds to it.
18.  If you don't mind fish sauce or coriander I really recommend this Asian-style spaghetti aglio e oilo.
