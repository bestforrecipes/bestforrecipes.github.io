To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have restaurant-style california roll using 16 ingredients and 13 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Restaurant-style California Roll:

1.  Make ready Fillings
2.  Prepare 1 Mayonnaise
3.  Get 1 Masago (capelin roe)
4.  Take 1 Nori seaweed (cut in half)
5.  Take 1 Avocado
6.  Make ready 1 packet Imitation crab sticks
7.  Make ready 1 Mayonnaise
8.  Take 1 Masago (capelin roe)
9.  Take 540 ml Uncooked white rice
10.  Make ready 1 tbsp Sake
11.  Make ready 1 tbsp Mirin
12.  Make ready 1 sheet Kombu seaweed (3 cm square)
13.  Make ready Vinegar water
14.  Prepare 30 ml Sushi vinegar
15.  Make ready 30 ml Water
16.  Prepare 1 pinch Salt

##### Instructions to make Restaurant-style California Roll:

1.  Add sake and mirin to the rice when cooking, and use 1 mm less water than usual. Don't cook the rice using the 'sushi rice' setting, just use the regular program.
2.  Lay the kombu on top of the rice and switch the rice cooker on!
3.  Put the sushi vinegar ingredients in a small pan and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat off immediately.
4.  Add the boiled sushi vinegar and water to the freshly cooked rice, leave to cool down a bit, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent from drying out.
5.  Spread a piece of nori seaweed evenly with sushi rice. Slightly moisten your hands with water and flatten out the rice. Cover with plastic wrap.
6.  Turn it over, wrap and all, so that the nori side is facing up. Draw a thin line in the middle with mayonnaise.
7.  Top with avocado and crab sticks. If you put the avocado on the far side it may get mashed when you roll the sushi, so I think it's easier if you put the crab sticks on the far side and the avocado closer to you.
8.  Fold the plastic wrap that is sticking out on the side closer to you under the mat to make it easier to roll the sushi.
9.  Roll the sushi, and cut it with the wrap still on it. If you peel off the wrap with moistened hands, you won't get any sticky rice.
10.  Put the masago on the cut sushi roll pieces to finish. If you don't like masago, use ground white sesame seeds instead.
11.  How to cut an avocado Cut into the avocado lengthwise and you'll hit the pit. Slice all the way around the avocado.
12.  Twist both halves with your hands and it will end up as shown in the photo. Cut into the half with the pit lengthwise again, and push out the pit.
13.  Note: I cut each crab stick in half lengthwise. Adjust depending on how thick you want the crab sticks to be.
