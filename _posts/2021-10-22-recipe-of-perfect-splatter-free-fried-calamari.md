To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have splatter-free fried calamari using 9 ingredients and 13 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Splatter-free Fried Calamari:

1.  Take 2 Squid
2.  Prepare 50 ml Milk
3.  Take 1 clove Grated ginger or garlic
4.  Get 8 tbsp Plain flour
5.  Prepare 1 Egg
6.  Prepare 2/3 tsp Soy sauce
7.  Take 1 dash Pepper
8.  Make ready 1 Panko (dried)
9.  Get 1 Frying oil

##### Instructions to make Splatter-free Fried Calamari:

1.  Gently remove the innards from the squid. Once you have cleaned it out, peel the thin membrane. I am not going to use the legs and fins this time.
2.  A tip to prevent oil splattering is to remove the thin membrane. Make shallow, vertical cuts in the backside and use a paper towel to peel off.
3.  The main reason why oil splatters is due to the moisture content in the squid.
4.  Pat dry and then brine in soy sauce. This helps drain the water.
5.  Take the squid from Step 4 and mix it with the listed amount of flour. Combine with garlic, soy sauce, salt, pepper, and milk, then mix.
6.  You could use ginger instead of garlic for the seasoning. Let it marinate for a bit and then add in the egg and a little bit of flour. The coating should be a little thicker than normal.
7.  Instead of adding in all the flour at once, use your judgement to add more as necessary.
8.  Coat the squid entirely with panko so that the water content from the squid won't leak.
9.  Heat 2-3 cm of oil in a frying pan. Then drop the squid rings into the oil and fry. Be sure to have the heat on medium!
10.  If you don't have enough oil, it becomes difficult to cook the squid because the temperature will fluctuate. Use a generous amount of oil.
11.  If you cook them for too long, they will be hard on the inside. I recommend cooking for about 1-1.5 minutes. They will still cook in residual heat, so take that in consideration.
12.  This method isn't 100% accurate, so some oil may splatter. Serve with tartare sauce
13.  Tartar Sauce
