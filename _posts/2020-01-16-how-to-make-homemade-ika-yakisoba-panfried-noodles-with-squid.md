##### The ingredients needed to make Ika Yakisoba (Panfried Noodles with Squid):

6.  Make ready 2 tbsp Okonomiyaki sauce
7.  Make ready 1 dash Salt
8.  Make ready 1 dash Pepper
9.  Get 1 dash Umami seasoning
10.  Get 1 Aonori

##### Instructions to make Ika Yakisoba (Panfried Noodles with Squid):

1.  Separate the noodles, put them in a heated non-stick frying pan, and pan fry them over high-medium heat to brown them. When they start to make a crackling sound, turn them over.
2.  When some of the noodles are very lightly browned, transfer the noodles to a plate.
3.  Julienne the cabbage thinly Soak in a bowl of water for a while, and drain.
4.  Open up the squid. We'll use the head part and the legs for this recipe. You can use the good body part too, but I use that for other recipes.
5.  Cut the legs apart into pairs, then cut each leg into thirds. Cut the head part in half lengthwise and then slice thinly.
6.  Put the ground pork in the frying pan you used to cook the noodles and stir fry. When it's more or less cooked, add the squid and stir fry again. (Medium heat.)
7.  When the squid is cooked, add the cabbage, salt and pepper and umami seasoning, and stir fry. When the cabbage has wilted, shove the contents of the frying pan to one side. (Medium heat.)
8.  Return the noodles to the pan in the empty space, add 3 tablespoons of the Worcestershire-style sauce, and coat the noodles with it (Medium heat.)
9.  When the sauce has coated the noodles, mix the ingredients that were shoved to the side in. Add the rest of the sauce and the okonomiyaku sauce and mix well. (High-medium heat.)
10.  When everything is well mixed it's done! Optionally serve topped with aonori or a fried egg and so on.
11.  The flavor of Worcestershire-style sauce differs by the brand, so adjust to taste.
12.  Basically, it's OK to cook this without adding any oil, but if you're worried that it will stick, you can add some when you pan fry the noodles.
