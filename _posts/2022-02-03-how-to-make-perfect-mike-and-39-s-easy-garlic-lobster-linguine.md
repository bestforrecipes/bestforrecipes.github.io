##### Steps to make Mike's Easy Garlic Lobster Linguine:

1.  Dethaw your pre-cooked lobster claws in fridge. Reserve all fluids within your bag for your linguine water noodle boil. Or, 1 cup seafood broth/stock.
2.  Once claws are dethawed, pour those fluids at the base of the bag into your linguine boil pot, or, add 1 cup seafood stock/broth and bring to a heavy boil. Also, add your salt and olive oil. Your linguini will soak up that sweet seafood flavor quite well!
3.  In a seperate pan, place everything in the White Alfredo Lobster Sauce section. Hold off on the lobster.
4.  Remove rubber bands from claws. One by one, place a Ziplock Bag \[or equivalent\] over the claw\[s\] - with a towel over them and break up your shells with a kitchen mallet. Break all of them and remove lobster meat.
5.  Triple check your lobster for any hidden shells. Trust me - they'll be well hidden. Rough chop your lobster meat. You'll be able to feel for additional shells during your rough chop as a fourth check. ° Place your lobster meat into your white sauce. Heat until hot then immediately reduce to low. Remember, your lobster meat is already pre-cooked. You don't want it chewy by over cooking it.
6.  Boil your linguine for 2 minutes UNDER manufactures directions, \[usually about 10 minutes but read directions\] quickly drain completely \[do not rinse noodles\] and place in your white sauce. Place a tight fitting lid upon it and allow sauce to simmer on high for 2 to 3 minutes longer.
7.  This dish could easily serve four due to the richness of it. Serve with thick garlic bread and garnish with parsley. Try my easy garlic butter recipe if you're interested.
