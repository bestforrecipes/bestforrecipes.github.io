It is a culinary dish prepared with stacked layers of pasta modified with sauces and ingredients such. From Italian lasagna (and its plural lasagne), possibly from Vulgar Latin \*lasania, from Latin lasanum ("cooking pot"), from Ancient Greek λάσανον (lásanon, "trivet or stand for a pot"). Others argue the Italian lasagna originally derived from the Arabic لَوْزِينَج‎ (lawzīnaj, "almond cake"). Pasta noodles piled high and layered full of three kinds of cheese to go along with the perfect blend of meaty and zesty, tomato pasta sauce all loaded with herbs.

##### Instructions to make Lasagna:

1.  Preheat oven to 350°. Grease a 13x9 pan including on the sides. Boil water in a large stock pot.
2.  Boil lasagna noodles according to package (typically 9 minutes). Drain and immediately run cold water over them.
3.  I like to lay my noodles out on parchment paper to ensure they stay flat as I'm working.
4.  Spread thin layer of sauce (approximately one ladle full) on bottom of pan.
5.  Arrange 4 noodles in pan, slightly overlapping, to start first layer.
6.  Add 1/2 Filling for Lasagna (available in my recipes). I use a melon baller to scoop it into a grid of 12 (3x4) and then spread evenly out with the back of a spoon. Just makes for easy quick and even distribution.
7.  Sprinkle grated mozzarella, grated parmesan, and fennel seeds over filling mixture.
8.  Use approximately 1.5-2 ladles of sauce to cover 1st layer. Spread evenly with back of spoon.
9.  Repeat assembly for 2nd layer. (4 noodles, other half of ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, fennel seed, sauce)
10.  Last layer, add final 4 noodles, cover with sauce, generously cover with mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley.
11.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake 45 minutes. Remove foil. Increase oven temp to 400°. Bake 15 minutes more. Remove and let cool 45 minutes to set.
12.  (optional): I usually double the recipe, assembling two. I put one in the oven. The other, I add the foil, then wrap the entire pan over and under well with saran wrap, and freeze it. I remove to refrigerator the day before I want to bake it, discard the saran wrap, and bake it the same as above.

Classic Lasagna is great for feeding a crowd, and also freezes well for new mom meals and quick thaw dinners.

Lasagna has many versions, both within Italy and around the world, but when we talk about "real" lasagna in Italy we mean "Lasagna alla Bolognese" i.e., from Bologna in the region of Emilia-Romagna.
