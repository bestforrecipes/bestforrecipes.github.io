There are many cold dishes in China which equals to salad in western centuries for example Chinese cabbage salad, cucumber salads, spicy chickens salad. Usually Elaine has two ways of making easy Chinese cucumber salad: one is to smash it directly before mixing and the other one is to pickle. (We like to chop at a diagonal.) Do the same to each cucumber. Squeeze cucumber lightly to remove most of the juice. Mix together the chopped cucumber, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil.
