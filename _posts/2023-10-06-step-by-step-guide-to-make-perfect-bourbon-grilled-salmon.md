##### Instructions to make Bourbon Grilled Salmon:

1.  Heat your grill for a high temp, laying out whiskey barrel wood chunks to infuse the fish with a nice smokey scent and flavor. (I have a gas grill so I got a sheet of foil, laid the wood pieces in it, wrapped it up, then poked some holes in it to allow the smoke to escape.)
2.  Lay out salmon on a sheet of aluminum foil and curl the edges to prevent liquids escaping.
3.  Top with Mediterranean Sea salt and fresh dill.
4.  Melt the butter in a small sauce pan over medium-low heat .
5.  Add the brown sugar and the bourbon .
6.  Stir until incorporated and pour on salmon.
7.  Cut the bottom ends off the asparagus to remove any white bits and add to a sheet of aluminum foil curled as mentioned in step 2.
8.  Add salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and the orange zest to the asparagus; mix to combine.
9.  Add the fish and asparagus to the grill and cover.
10.  Add olive oil to a pan and heat over medium heat.
11.  Once the oil is hot, add the spinach and garlic.
12.  Toss until slightly wilted and remove frome heat.
13.  Cook fish until an internal temp from the thickest part reads 145°F and remove salmon and asparagus from heat.
14.  Plate the spinach as a bed for the fish, then add the salmon to rest upon it. Add asparagus as you see fit.
15.  I recommend serving with a nice glass of bourbon.
