##### Steps to make Deliciously Baked Shrimp & Kale Wontons:

1.  preheat oven to 375° & get out a large baking sheet
2.  take a sheet of foil, enough to more than cover the baking sheet, crunch the foil and then line the baking sheet so that there are plenty of "airy" spaces.
3.  lightly spray foil with olive oil
4.  add carrots, kale, and cabbage to food processor, chop fine
5.  add in minced garlic, crushed red peppers, chives, pepper, and soy sauce, chop till fine but don't let it turn into a sauce
6.  scoop out ingredients into a medium mixing bowl
7.  rinse out processor, and add in shrimp (make sure these are cooked, cleaned, devained, tail off), and chop but don't completely mince
8.  add to mixing bowl, and fold/mix
9.  take out package of wonton wrappers, you'll need at least 18-20
10.  get a small bowl of water for gluing the wonton wrappers, and a paper towel for drying fingers between gluing (as needed)
11.  lay wrapper out flat, add about 1 tablespoon of filling to the middle
12.  dip a finger in water, and wet 2 edges of the wrapper, and fold over into a triangle
13.  dry your fingers, and pinch the edges together. I usually start at the top of the triangle, and work backwards
14.  lay each wonton onto the baking sheet, not letting them touch
15.  after all wontons are laid out on the baking sheet, lightly spray with olive oil
16.  bake in middle oven rack approximately 10 minutes
17.  remove and flip each wonton - I can usually just grab a corner and flip them
18.  place back in oven and bake on the other side for another 3 minutes
19.  remove, and enjoy either as they are, or with your favorite soy-based dipping sauce
