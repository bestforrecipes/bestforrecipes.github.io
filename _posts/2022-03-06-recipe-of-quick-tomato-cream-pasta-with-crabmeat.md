##### Instructions to make Tomato Cream Pasta with Crabmeat:

2.  Remove any tough part and skin from the tomatoes and squash roughly.
3.  Pour in the olive oil and garlic into a cold frying pan and place the pan on a low heat. Infuse the oil with garlic.
4.  Once the water has boiled, add the pasta. Stop cooking one minute before the package instructions.
5.  As soon as the garlic turns golden brown, remove it. Add the crabmeat and fry. Add the white wine and increase the heat to high to evaporate the alcohol.
