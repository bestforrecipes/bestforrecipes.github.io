Make sure your legs aren't submerged in the water. You'll want them just above it. - - Steam legs for 5 to 7 minutes depending upon thickness. - - Turn off heat and leave legs in pot covered.
2.  Chop and mince your vegetables. Pull your fresh Thai Basil and Cilantro leaves as well. Those leaves will be mixed into your noodles and broth just before serving.
3.  Bring your broth \[with oriental flavor packets if using top ramen\] to a steady boil. - - If using Canton Noodles - add additional Siracha in place of Top Ramen noodle flavor packets.

5.  Picture of authentic Ramen Noodles. No seasoning packets included.
