##### Steps to make Mike's Spicy Thai Chilled Shrimp Salad:

3.  Place cucumbers into a strainer and add 1 tbsp salt to them. Mix well and let set for 30 minutes to drain.
4.  In the meantime, split jalapeños and remove seeds with spoon.
5.  Fine dice jalapeños. Add to bowl. Wear gloves!

11.  Peel one end of your fresh ginger and grate. Add to bowl.
12.  Add your Lemon Grass to bowl.
13.  Add your Dried Shrimp to bowl.
14.  Gently wipe clean your Oyster Mushrooms with a damp paper towel. Do not rinse as they will absorb all of that water.
15.  Chop your Water Chestnuts and add to bowl.
16.  Rough chop mushrooms. Add to bowl.
17.  Slice your purple onions and add to bowl.
18.  Pick fresh leaves from Thai Basil stems.

21.  Rinse your cucumbers and dab dry with a paper towel. Add to bowl.
22.  Mix salad gently but well. Then, refrigerate.
23.  Bring a small pot of water to a boil and add your snap peas. You'll need to blanche these to soften them up a bit and kill any bacteria. Blanche for 2 minutes even.
24.  Have a bowl of ice water ready to immediately submerge them into to stop the cooking process. Allow them to chill fully.
25.  In the meantime - make your sauce.
26.  In a small pot add everything in the sauce section. Bring to a simmer until sugar has dissolved. This may seem like it's not enough to coat your vegetable mixture - I assure you it is. Allow sauce to completely cool. You don't want your vegetables going limp.
27.  Add snap peas to your refrigerated mixture.
28.  Add cooled sauce mixture to your bowl. Gently mix well. Place back in fridge and allow it to absorb all flavors for 30 minutes minimum. Then, place in a decorative bowl. Allow dish to chill 10 minutes longer in fridge so your dried shrimp can plump a bit.

30.  Serve with a quality Sake. Enjoy!
