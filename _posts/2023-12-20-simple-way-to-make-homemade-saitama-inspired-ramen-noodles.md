##### Steps to make Saitama-Inspired Ramen Noodles:

1.  Ingredient Introduction: These are the kombu seaweed sheets and assorted fish flakes that I use. I bought them at the supermarket I work at.
2.  I also bought this at work. 400 yen is cheap for 1 kg!
3.  This ramen takes 2 days to complete. Let's start making it the day before you want to eat.
4.  Preparations: Mix the ○ Japanese-style base together. Let it sit overnight. (Place into the fridge in summer).
5.  Preparation: Wash off the blood from the pork and chicken bones in running water, and break the pork bones in half at the joint.
6.  Preparation: Hold the pigs feet with a pair of tongs, burn the hairs over gas flame, and wash well with water.
7.  Preparation: Roll the meat up from the thick end, and tightly tie with kitchen twine. Roll the ※ breast meat in the same manner.
8.  Preparation: Wash the vegetables, and cut into approximate sizes. Caution: Do not remove the skins.
9.  Make the soup: Place the pork bones into a 7~10 liter pot with lots of water, and boil over strong heat. Skim off the scum.
10.  Add chicken bones, pork belly, and pigs feet once there is no more scum, and continue boiling over medium heat while continuing to remove the scum.
11.  Add everything from the onions to the red peppers, boil for 2 hours, and turn off the heat.
12.  Char siu: Remove the pork belly out of the soup, and boil together with the breast meat for 2 hours in the cha siu sauce. See ID: 911531 for details.
13.  Making the noodle dough: Refer to, and chill in the fridge overnight. - - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen)
14.  Day 2 starts from this point onwards. First, turn the heat onto the soup pot.
15.  Making the Soy Sauce Dressing: Set aside the amount indicated into a pot from Step 4 that was left to sit overnight in the fridge, and make the soy sauce dressing while referring to. - - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen)
16.  Make the soup: After bringing to a boil, leave in the pork bones, pigs feet and chicken bones, and remove the mushy vegetables from the soup.
17.  Add the Japanese-style base mixture (all of the broth, konbu seaweed and shiitake mushrooms) from Step 4 into the soup, and boil over a low heat for 2 hours. The soup is now done.
18.  Making the Noodles: Usingas a reference, divide the dough into 10 equal portions. Make the noodles in a pasta machine 1.7~2 mm thick, and 2 mm wide. Chill in the fridge. - - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen)
19.  Making the bamboo shoots: Bring water to a boil in a frying pan, quickly boil the boiled bamboo shoots in water, and strain.
20.  Lightly saute the bamboo shoots and red pepper in a frying pan heated with sesame oil, add the flavoring, and saute until there are about 2 tablespoons of broth remaining. Transfer to a bowl and place into the fridge.
21.  Finishing steps: Decide on the combination of soup and soy sauce dressing. Use roughly 360~400 ml of soup: 35~50 ml of soy sauce dressing. Adjust to suite your tastes.
22.  Cut the well-chilled chashu into your desired thickness. Thinly cut the Japanese leek. Please refer tofor the marinated eggs. - - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen)
23.  Finishing Touch: Add hot water to a bowl to warm it up. Boil lots of water in a large pot, and boil the noodles for 4-5 minutes.
24.  Heat the bowl while the noodles are boiling, add the soy sauce dressing, and soup while using a sieve to strain. Add the thinly sliced noodles, top with the ingredients, and it is done!
25.  To put it simply, these noodles have the opposite texture of being chewy. They are more springy with a toothsome texture.
26.  Extra 1: Throwing out the soy sauce and soup broth is wasteful! So, use it to make tsukudani that goes well with rice.
27.  Cut the konb seaweed into thin strips, and shred the rest in a food processor.
28.  Saute together with 3 tablespoons each of sake and sugar and 1 tablespoon of mirin until the broth evaporates, add 1~2 tablespoons of white sesame for the finishing touch, and it is done.
29.  Place into a Tupperware container, and store in the fridge. This tastes the best mixed with rice.
30.  Extra 2: If you have a dog or cat at home, mixing the vegetables (aside from the onions and leeks) with a bit of the chicken bone and meat etc. into their food will make them really happy.
