2.  This time I used Chicken. Cut the chicken fillets into bite-size pieces and cook them first. If you use Seafood, see Step 4.
3.  Heat 1 tablespoon Oil in an oven-safe shallow saucepan or a skillet over medium heat and cook Chicken until slightly brown, and transfer to a plate. If you don’t use Chicken, skip this process. Add extra Oil and cook Onion and Garlic until soft.
4.  Add Rice and stir for 1-2 minutes or until coated with the oil and lightly toasted. Add the stock and stir, and bring to the boil. Arrange the chicken pieces over the rice evenly. If you cook Seafood, place them on the rice now. Cover with the lid or cover tightly with foil.
5.  Place the saucepan or a skillet in the oven, and cook for 15-20 minutes. You may wish to brown the top by baking without the lid for 5-10 minutes.
6.  Sprinkle with the Chopped Parsley and serve.
