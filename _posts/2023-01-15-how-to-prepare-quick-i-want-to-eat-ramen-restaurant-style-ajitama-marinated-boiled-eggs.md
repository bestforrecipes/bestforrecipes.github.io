5.  After boiling for 8 minutes, turn the heat off and leave for 2 minutes. If you're using the egg timer gadget, it should be at the 'medium' line. Leave until the line becomes blurred.

7.  Peel the eggs, and plop them in the plastic container. Turn the eggs to coat them in the marinade. (I didn't peel the eggs too well, so one is really bumpy..)
8.  When the eggs have cooled down, put the lid on the container and marinate the eggs for about 1 hour in the refrigerator. Turn them over whenever you think of it, using chopsticks.
9.  Done! I make it before I go to bed and eat it the next day.
