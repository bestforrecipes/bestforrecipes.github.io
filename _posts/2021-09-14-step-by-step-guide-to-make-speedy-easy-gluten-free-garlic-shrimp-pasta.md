We used Angel Hair Rice Pasta for this dish, so delicious! I used to be a total pasta lover, but since going Gluten Free I haven't had much pasta lately. Awhile back I discovered Rice Noodles, to me it tastes just as good as regular. this garlic shrimp is an easy one pot dish perfect for an appetizer, side or to spoon over pasta. Tender and juicy shrimp are cooked in a garlicky and buttery sauce before being tossed with baby spinach and parmesan.

##### Steps to make Easy Gluten Free Garlic Shrimp Pasta:

1.  If your shrimp is frozen, take them out of the freezer to thaw and put them in room temperature water. This will help them thaw faster.
2.  Bring a pot of water to a boil, salt, add olive oil, add pasta. cook according to package directions.
3.  in a large saucepan, melt the ghee or butter on medium heat, about 1 minute.
4.  add diced shallots to melted ghee, cook until semi-translucent, about 3-5 minutes. (NOTE: DO NOT add the garlic with the shallots, the garlic will burn before the shallots cook through.)
5.  when shallots are semi-translucent, add the garlic. cook for another 2-3 minutes and reduce temperature to med-low heat.
6.  Add shrimp. If raw, sauté until they turn pink through-out, about 3-4 minutes on each side. If precooked, sauté for 5 minutes so the flavors can coat the shrimp, but not too long so the meat doesn't toughen.
7.  drain the pasta, transfer to a medium tupperware container with a lid or large mixing bowl
8.  toss the contents of the saucepan, pasta, cheese, and salt & pepper, together.
9.  Open container and enjoy. Add more cheese if so desired. (I use A LOT!)
