2.  Put one slice into a frying pan,buttered side down
3.  Top with a generous layer of cheese then any other fillings you'd like to add. I also like to shake some Worcestershire sauce on before adding the cheese - - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/335730-vickys-coconut-milk-cheddar-cheese](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/335730-vickys-coconut-milk-cheddar-cheese) - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/338187-vickys-homemade-worcestershire-sauce-vegan](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/338187-vickys-homemade-worcestershire-sauce-vegan)
4.  Put the other slice of bread on top, buttered side up. Turn the heat on to medium
5.  Fry for 2 minutes until golden then flip, press down and fry another 2 minutes on the other side
6.  Let rest a minute before cutting into triangles and serve. Add chips / fries and a side salad for a satisfying lunch
7.  Anything that goes on a pizza will work in a toastie. Use different cheeses for different ingredients like a mexican cheese with chicken and roasted peppers, brie with turkey and cranberry sauce or goats cheese with parma ham and pear for a posh vibe!
8.  Dessert toasties are great served with custard or ice cream. Just mix the cream cheese with powdered sugar to taste then spoon a few tablespoons over the fruit filling - - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/346731-vickys-coconut-cream-cheese](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/346731-vickys-coconut-cream-cheese) - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/332987-vickys-vanilla-custard-gluten-dairy-egg-soy-nut-free](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/332987-vickys-vanilla-custard-gluten-dairy-egg-soy-nut-free) - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/332956-vickys-vanilla-ice-cream-with-flavour-variations-gf-df-ef-sf-nf](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/332956-vickys-vanilla-ice-cream-with-flavour-variations-gf-df-ef-sf-nf) - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/354252-vickys-homemade-sunflower-butter-alternative-for-peanut-butter](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/354252-vickys-homemade-sunflower-butter-alternative-for-peanut-butter) - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/367890-vickys-homemade-nutella-no-nut-chocolate-spread](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/367890-vickys-homemade-nutella-no-nut-chocolate-spread)
