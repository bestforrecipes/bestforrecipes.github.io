##### Instructions to make Chicken/ Shrimp Pot Stickers and Ginger Dipping Sauce:

3.  Grease your steamer basket.. put one layer of pot stickers in your basket. Put a little water in he bottom of your dutch oven or crockpot and steam pot stickers for 8-10 minutes.
4.  In small bowl combine ingredients for the dipping sauce.
5.  \*\*\*\* these can be frozen… fix pot stickers and place on cookie sheet in a single layer to freeze. Freeze on wax paper and cover with another layer as the freeze. Once frozen put them in a freezer bag.
6.  thaw dumplings when u r ready to cook
7.  When taking them out steam them until cooked completely throug 15 minutes after the water begins boiling.
8.  \*\*\*\* can use cabbage, bean sprouts, shredded carrots, and tofu …for a veggie only dumpling.
9.  I fix a combo of veggie, pork, chicken, and shrimp and freeze them in seperate Ziploc bags so I can tell them apart…

11.  these dumplings can also be fried…. put oil in a non stick skillet and cook until golden. make sure dumplings are in a single layer. put a half cup of water in the skillet … cook for 5-7 minutes until water is absorbed.
