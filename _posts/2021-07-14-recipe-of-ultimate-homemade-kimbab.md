5.  Set up the sushi roller on your counter along with a sheet of sushi seaweed paper, scoop a scoop of seasoned rice and place it in the middle of the seaweed. Wet your fingers and spread rice thinly onto the seaweed, but leave some space on the top and bottom of the seaweed to help seal the roll later.

7.  To roll the kimbab, take the bottom part of the sushi roller, loft it up and make sure you tuck in the bottom part of the seaweed into the kimbab itself. Use the roller to tighten the roll as you go. Make sure you lift up the edge of the roller as you roll it so that it doesn't get roller into the kimbab! After rolling it, i would turn it around and use the roller to squeeze the kimbab tightly so it doesn't fall apart
