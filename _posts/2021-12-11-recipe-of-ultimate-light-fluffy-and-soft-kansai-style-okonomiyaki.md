Whether you prefer them thick and fluffy or flat and foldable, we all love a good pancake. Practically as old as civilisation itself, there are hardly any countries in the world that do not. The style and the ingredients of okonomiyaki also depend on the region, the two most prominent varieties are the Osaka and Hiroshima-style The Osaka type, also referred to as Kansai, is considered to be the traditional and more popular variety, where the condiments are usually mixed. This recipe is for the Osaka-style version, which can be topped with a variety of ingredients.

##### Instructions to make Light, Fluffy, and Soft Kansai-Style Okonomiyaki:

1.  Make dashi stock (I used dried bonito, konbu and stock powder) and leave to cool. Chop the cabbage and pickled ginger. Slice the Japanese leek. After preparing the squid slice into thin batons (7 mm x 2-3 cm). Cut the tentacles into the similar sizes. Cut the pork into bite sizes or leave as they are.
2.  Mix the flour with dashi stock and beaten eggs in a bowl. Peel and grate the nagaimo yam and add to the bowl. Mix in all the ingredients except the pork.
3.  Heat vegetable oil in a non-stick pan and pour the batter. Fry over medium to high heat for about 3 minutes (don't cover or touch).
4.  Place the sliced pork on top. Shake the pan and remove the okonomiyaki bottom from the frying pan. Flip over when the edge of the batter starts to brown (the batter is quite runny, so it might be difficult.)
5.  After flipping over, cover with a lid and reduce heat to low. Fry for about 6 minutes and flip over when the bottom of the okonomiyaki is evenly browned. Cover with a lid and fry for another 3 minutes. Uncover and fry for another 3 minutes. Done!
6.  I noted the cooking time as 3 min → 6 min → 3 min → 3 min but my husband usually doesn't use a timer! When both sides are nicely browned like the top photo, it's ready. In the last 3 minutes, uncover and fry until crispy. This okonomiyaki has lots of nagaimo yam so the fluffy and soft texture remains even after cooking too long.
7.  Serve with your favorite toppings.
8.  My husband may change the ratio or ingredients in the future, so I will keep you posted.

Perhaps the most common version is Osaka-style okonomiyaki, which is also known as the Kansai-style. Osaka is known for an inexpensive and abundant food culture.
