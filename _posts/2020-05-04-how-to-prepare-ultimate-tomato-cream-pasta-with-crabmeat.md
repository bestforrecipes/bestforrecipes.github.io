2.  Remove any tough part and skin from the tomatoes and squash roughly.

4.  Once the water has boiled, add the pasta. Stop cooking one minute before the package instructions.
5.  As soon as the garlic turns golden brown, remove it. Add the crabmeat and fry. Add the white wine and increase the heat to high to evaporate the alcohol.
6.  After the alcohol has evaporated, add the tomatoes and salt. Once the sauce has boiled, turn the heat to low and reduce the sauce by 1/2. By cooking the sauce, it rounds out the tartness of the tomatoes.
7.  After the sauce has reduced by 1/2, season lightly with salt. Turn off the heat.
