Remove and discard the stems of the kale; roughly chop the leaves. Peel and finely chop the ginger. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Cut off and discard the root ends of the scallions; thinly slice, separating the white bottoms and green tops.
2.  Add the chopped kale to the pot of boiling water. Cook 5 to 7 minutes, or until wilted. Drain thoroughly and set aside in a warm place. Refill the pot with salted water; heat to boiling on high.
3.  While the kale cooks, reserving the water, transfer the rehydrated shiitake mushrooms to a cutting board; roughly chop. In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chopped mushrooms, and sliced white bottoms of the scallions; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant.
4.  Add the reserved mushroom water, soy marinade, and sweet chili sauce. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium; cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 6 minutes, or until the liquid is slightly reduced in volume. Turn off the heat; stir in the cooked kale and sesame oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide between 2 bowls. Rinse and wipe out the pan.
