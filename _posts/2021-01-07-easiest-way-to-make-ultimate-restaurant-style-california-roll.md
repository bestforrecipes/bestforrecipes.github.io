2.  Lay the kombu on top of the rice and switch the rice cooker on!
3.  Put the sushi vinegar ingredients in a small pan and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat off immediately.
4.  Add the boiled sushi vinegar and water to the freshly cooked rice, leave to cool down a bit, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent from drying out.
5.  Spread a piece of nori seaweed evenly with sushi rice. Slightly moisten your hands with water and flatten out the rice. Cover with plastic wrap.
