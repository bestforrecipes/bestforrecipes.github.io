##### The ingredients needed to make Soup Base - Seafood, Fish Or Vegetable:

##### Instructions to make Soup Base - Seafood, Fish Or Vegetable:

2.  Let reduce to about 2 cups of water over low to medium heat. If you are watching it then you can use higher temperatures.
3.  Add rest of water and reduce to about 1 quart.
4.  Using a sieve or colander with cheese cloth (or even a cotton towel) filter out all the chunks of material.
5.  Using a smaller pot continue to reduce to stock further till the boiling bubbles start to last longer and the liquid becomes syrup like.
