To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook seafood cocktail salad using 11 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Seafood Cocktail Salad:

1.  Prepare salad
2.  Prepare 4 lb shrimp, cooked, peeled, deveined
3.  Prepare 4 lb artificial crab meat, lump style
4.  Make ready 6 cucumbers
5.  Take 2 bunches celery hearts
6.  Make ready 4 yellow bell peppers
7.  Prepare 1 head lettuce, shredded
8.  Make ready cocktail sauce
9.  Prepare 64 oz ketchup
10.  Take 6 tbsp double-strength horseradish
11.  Get 3 large lemons

##### Instructions to make Seafood Cocktail Salad:

1.  The only difficult part of this recipe is finding a container large enough to mix it in. I use the Tupperware "Thatsa(tm) Bowl" 32-cup mega mixing bowl, and I still had to mix it up in two batches.
2.  For the cocktail sauce, empty a 64-ounce bottle of ketchup into a large bowl. Juice the lemons and pour the juice into the ketchup bottle and swish it around to get the remaining ketchup. Pour it into the bowl and add bits of the lemon pulp. Stir in the horseradish.
3.  Peel the cucumbers, but not completely. You want to leave some strips of the peel for color contrast. Slice in quarters lengthwise and remove the seeds. Cut the cucumbers into chunks. Cut the celery into chunks about the same size as the cucumbers. Your cucumber and celery chunks should be close in size to your seafood.
4.  Cut the bell peppers in half and remove seeds. Cut into thin strips.
5.  Put the shrimp, artificial crab, cucumbers, celery and bell peppers into a jumbo mixing bowl. Pour on the cocktail sauce and mix well.
6.  Cover the bottom of your serving dish with a 1-inch thick layer of the shredded lettuce. Spoon the seafood cocktail salad on top of the lettuce. Garnish around the side with slices or wedges of lemon.
