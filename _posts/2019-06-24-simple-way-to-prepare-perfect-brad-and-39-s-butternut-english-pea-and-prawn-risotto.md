##### Instructions to make Brad's Butternut, English Pea and Prawn Risotto:

2.  Heat a large frying pan over medium heat. When hot, add 2 tbs olive oil. Add 1 clove garlic and shallots. Saute until shallots are sweated off, but not browned.
3.  Add rice to frying pan and cook for a couple minutes. Do not let it brown.
4.  Add the wine, stir very often until it absorbs into the rice most of the way. Star adding the broth, one cup at a time. Let it absorb most of the way between additions.
5.  When you add the 3rd cup of stock. Add the blanched squash, peas, bacon, and squash puree.
6.  Meanwhile heat another pan. Add oil. Saute remaining garlic for 30 seconds. Add prawns and season with salt and pepper. The prawns should only need about 2 minutes per side. When done, drain on paper towels.
7.  Taste the rice. It should be tender, yet not mushy. Just a little bite to it. You may or may not need all of the last cup of broth. Adjust seasoning. Add the butter and parmesan at the end. Mix well.
