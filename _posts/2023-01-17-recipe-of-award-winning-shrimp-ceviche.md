Hey everyone, I hope you’re having an amazing day today. Today, we’re going to prepare a special dish, shrimp ceviche. One of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Shrimp Ceviche is one of the most well liked of current trending foods on earth. It’s simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It’s enjoyed by millions every day. They are nice and they look wonderful. Shrimp Ceviche is something which I’ve loved my entire life.

To get started with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook shrimp ceviche using 8 ingredients and 9 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Shrimp Ceviche:

1.  Prepare 1 lb shrimp peeled and devined
2.  Prepare 5 large tomatoes
3.  Get 1 large white onion
4.  Prepare 2-5 serrano or jalapeño peppers
5.  Make ready 1 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
6.  Take 3/4 cup ketchup
7.  Make ready to taste Guacamaya or Huichol hot sauce
8.  Take to taste salt and pepper

##### Steps to make Shrimp Ceviche:

1.  Slice shrimp in half lengthwise, and cut into small pieces.
2.  Place shrimp in large bowl and add salt and lime juice. There should be enough juice to fully coat all the shrimp pieces. Mix very well, take the time to separate all the pieces. The shrimp should NOT be sticking to each other, if it is, then add more lime juice. SHRIMP IS "COOKED" WHEN IT IS OPAQUE. By the time you chop the other ingredients it should be done.
3.  Super finely chop the peppers. How many you want is up to you. I like mine spicy so I add a lot. Its just important to really finely chop, because big chunks of pepper gives uneven spice.
4.  Chop the tomoates and onions to a fine dice.
5.  Add vegetables to the shrimp and lime mixture.
6.  Add ketchup, more salt and pepper, and hot sauce. The reason why i recommend Guacamaya or Huichol hot sauce is because it gives the heat without any extra condiments that would interfere with the flavor of the shrimp; like a hot sauce like tapatio or cholula would.
7.  Mix everything well. And maintain refrigerated until ready to serve.
8.  Enjoy with tostadas or plain corn chips!
9.  Sidenote: this recipe existed before Clamato came out, we do not use it because we feel it waters down the flavor.
