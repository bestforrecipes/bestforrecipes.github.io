Shrimp and Grits is a classic Southern dish that's quick and easy enough for a busy weeknight meal. I was shocked when I first discovered how ridiculously easy it is to make shrimp and grits, because it's such a typical restaurant dish that I think of as really flavorful and full of pizzazz. This recipe for shrimp and grits starts with a clever tip for jump-starting the grits that I learned from Southern chef Sean Brock. In an ideal world, we'd all be getting fresh coastal shrimp for our shrimp and grits â€” but we'll settle for frozen shrimp with the shell on.

##### Instructions to make Shrimp + Grits w/ Pork Belly:

1.  Prep all the vegetables like peppers, onions, garlic, scallions, parsley and pork belly (this is so necessary)
2.  Add 4 cups of water to a stock pot and bring to a boil. Add in the grits and salt and stir. Once itâ€™s at a boil reduce to medium low and keep stirring. Cook for 25 min.
3.  In a large saucepan on medium heat add the pork belly and cook until crisp and fat is rendered
4.  Add the onions, garlic, jalapeÃ±os. SautÃ© for 2 min. Add shrimp (peeled and deveined) and season with salt and pepper). Cook for 4 minutes.
5.  Mix water and cornstarch in a bowl and set aside. This will thicken the shrimp and grits.
6.  Add the hot sauce, lemon juice, scallions to the pot and scrape the bacon bits on the bottom of the pan. Add cornstarch mixture and let come to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let simmer for 5 min while finishing up grits. Fold in butter and turn off the heat.
7.  When grits have soaked up most of the liquid (add more water if needed) add in the cream cheese and butter and stir for 2-3 minutes until combined. Turn off the heat.
8.  Plate grits and top with shrimp mixture. Garnish with scallions and parsley and enjoy! ðŸ¤¤
