##### Instructions to make CARBONARA of the SEA!!!:

1.  In a large fry pan, med-high heat, drizzle some olive oil then add the bacon, onion and garlic. Cook until soften but not crispy. Remove and place into a bowl.
2.  In same pan add the prawns, salmon and scollops. We're needing a nice brown colour but also slightly undercooked. Then set aside, on a plate.
3.  Still in the same pan. Save the juices from the seadfood. Add the prawn shells and cook off while crushing them. 20 minutes. With the lid on to produce liquid. Add the wine. Cook for another 10 minutes to cook off the alcohol and also still crushing the prawn shells to bring out maximum flavour. Strain in fine strainer, discard the shells. Add stock back to pan.
4.  Meanwhile, in a large pot, boil salted water. Add pasta, cook until al dante (slightly undercooked).
5.  Sauce- Reduce the heat. Remove pan from heat to cool slightly then add the egg yolks and wisk. Then place back onto low heat and continue to whisk for roughly 10-15 minutes or until sauce thickens. Every now n then take pan off heat to control the temperature. Needs to be quite thick. Once thickened, slowly add the butter, cpl cubes at a time and whisk. Turn heat off.
6.  Meanwhile dry the squid rings thoroughly with paper towel. In a bowl, add flour and season. Toss the squid rings thoroughly and remove. Shake off any excess flour. Cook in batches in a deep fryer or shallow fry on the stove, until golden. Remove and drain on paper towels.
7.  Drain pasta.
8.  In the pot used for the pasta, med-high heat. Put in the clams/pippies and the wine. Lid on. Steam. Tossing gently every minute. Remove opened pippes. Lid on and shake. Repeat. Discard any unopened pippies after 10 minutes (if frozen) 5 minutes (if not frozen). Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the liquid to the sauce to thin it. Stir, taste and season if needed. Stir in the parsley and the onion, bacon mixture.
9.  Add pasta, the rest of the seafood (except squid) to the sauce and toss gently. Add more pasta water if needed.
10.  Pour on to a large platter and place the squid rings on top. Grate over some parmesan cheese and sprinkle over extra parsley and lemon quarters. Serve immediately.
11.  Note: if the sauce is to rich for your liking then add a teaspoon of sour cream. I also served this with crispy salmon skin and spring onions.

Quizás para los que estén más acostumbrados a la otra receta les resultará raro esta receta de carbonara sin nata pero la primera carbonara que probé fue ésta y para mi es la salsa clásica aunque puedes encontrar muchas variantes (como usar el huevo entero o añadirle nata pero no cebolla). One thing that I liked about this Bacon and Mushroom Carbonara (aside from its delicious taste) is its ease of preparation. Add bacon and cook in medium heat until the bacon fat gets extracted.
