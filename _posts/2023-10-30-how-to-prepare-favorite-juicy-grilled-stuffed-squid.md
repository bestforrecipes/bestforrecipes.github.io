Peel off the skin of the ginger using a spoon and grate it using a cheese grater.
3.  PREPARE THE STUFFING MIXTURE: In a bowl, combine the garlic, onion, green chili, cilantro, and ginger, then season with salt and pepper. Grab the squid and rub some salt on each side. Stuff each squid with the stuffing mixture. secure with a toothpick so the stuffing will not spill out.

When you start to see some smoke, grill the stuffed squid for around 5-6 minutes each side flipping every 2-3 minutes until it is fully cooked. Since the squid head and tentacles require less time to cook, grill them when the stuffed squid is half-cooked. Do not overcook the squid as the texture will be rubbery and chewy.
