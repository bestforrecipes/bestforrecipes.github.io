##### Steps to make Chicken Tender Rolls With Two Flavors:

1.  Prep the ingredients you'll put inside the chicken rolls. Cut the sliced cheese into 4 pieces. Adjust the amount of umeboshi paste depending on how salty it is. I use homemade umeboshi which is quite sour so I only use a little.
2.  Remove the sinew from the chicken tenders and then butterfly them by slicing them almost all the way through horizontally and opening them up. A few holes in the meat are fine. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
3.  Smear the grainy mustard over one side of the chicken, put a piece of nori and cheese on top, and roll it up tightly towards the pointy ends of the chicken. Secure the rolls with wooden cocktail sticks. Make 4 rolls.
