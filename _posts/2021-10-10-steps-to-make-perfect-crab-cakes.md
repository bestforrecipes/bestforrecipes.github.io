##### Steps to make Crab cakes:

1.  This recipe is only for two people so I beat the egg and only use half. Add all ingredients except for the crackers and crab and whisk well, salt and pepper to taste.
2.  Gently fold in the crab being careful not to break it up, then fold in the crushed crackers. Store in fridge for at least 30 minutes or overnight in an airtight container.
3.  Pre heat the overnight to 450
4.  Grease a baking sheet and divide the mixture into 4 crab cakes but don’t smash them and try to keep them plump, you can press lightly in the middle if need be. Melt the butter and brush the top of each cake.
5.  Cook at 450 for about 10 minutes. When I remove them I hit the top with a flambé torch but you can crank the oven to high broil for a couple minutes. I serve them with an arugula salad with shaved carrots and cucumber with my honey lemon vinaigrette as well as my tarragon tartar sauce.
