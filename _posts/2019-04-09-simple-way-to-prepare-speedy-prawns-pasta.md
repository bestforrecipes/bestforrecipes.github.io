Pasta tossed with a rich tomato sauce with a tingle of spicy heat and plump prawns (shrimp). This Spicy Chilli Prawn Pasta is a total crowd pleaser to make all year round, and the only thing that requires chopping is parsley. As the garlic begins to colour, add the prawns and sauté them for a minute. Add the white wine and tomato purée, and simmer for a couple of minutes.

##### Steps to make Prawns pasta:

1.  Marinate the prawns in Salt and red chilli powder or black pepper for 15 - 30 minutes. The red chilli powder gives it a nice red look.
2.  Boil the prawns shells and heads in water to make a stock. Reduce it till the water is below the level of the shells.
3.  Fry the prawns in oil and set aside.
4.  Drop the pasta in boiling salt water (bring the water to a rolling boil to prevent the pasta sticking togather). Set a timer for 2 minutes lesser that the cooking time mentioned on the packet. Mine said 10 minutes so I set the timer at 8 mins.
5.  In the pan used to fry the prawns add 2-3 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil. Add the garlic and the sardines. Turn on the heat to medium after dropping in the garlic.
6.  Once the garlic starts to brown add the slit chillies and stir and break the sardines.
7.  Add the tomatoes after 30 seconds and allow to cook for a couple of minutes.
8.  Add salt and black pepper.
9.  Add 1 tbsp of tomato paste, olives and capers and parsley.
10.  Deglaze the pan with the prawns shell stock and reduce.
11.  Drop in the pasta and allow to cook for 2 minutes. Add pasta water to adjust consistency if required.
12.  Add grated parmesan and lemon zest.
13.  Serve in a plate. Finish it off with a tbsp of olive oil, parsley and parmesan.

Grate the zest of the lemon and roughly chop the rocket. When the pasta is ready, drain it in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water. First put the frozen prawns in a bowl and cover with warm water to defrost them. I always add a few drops of olive oil to the pasta when I am boiling it. When the pasta is ready, remove and drain in the sieve.
