To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook nikudofu - simmered meat and tofu using 7 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Nikudofu - Simmered Meat and Tofu:

1.  Get Australian beef (thinly sliced chuck roll)
2.  Take Tofu
3.  Make ready Onion
4.  Prepare of each ☆Soy sauce, sake, mirin, sugar
5.  Take Bonito or kombu based dashi stock granules
6.  Get Sashimi soy sauce
7.  Make ready Shredded white part of a leek and/or edamame (for garnish)

Cut the leek diagonally and the radish into thick quater-rounds. Nikujaga quite literally translates to "meat and potatoes" - niku means "meat" and jaga means "potatoes" in Japanese. It's a comfort food and the Japanese version of beef stew. The beef in Nikujaga is added more for flavor than substance.

##### Instructions to make Nikudofu - Simmered Meat and Tofu:

1.  Cut the onion in half lengthwise, then cut into 6 pieces crosswise into six pieces. Cut the half block of tofu into 6 pieces. If the beef slices are too big, cut into bite-sized pieces.
2.  Combine the soy sauce, sake, mirin and sugar into a frying pan with 100 ml of water, and put in the onion and tofu in one layer. Cook over medium heat until boiling, lower the heat to low and cover with a lid.
3.  This is the star of this dish, the meat. Inexpensive Aussie beef.
4.  When the onion turns translucent, add the beef. I just threw it in all together, but you should wave each slice around shabu-shabu style in the cooking liquid as you add it, or you may get one big clump of meat stuck together.
5.  If it bothers you, skim off the scum. Add the green onion to finish, turn off the heat, then add a little sashimi soy sauce (I think about 1 teaspoon).
6.  I garnished it with edamame. If you don't have any sashimi soy sauce, just use more regular soy sauce. That last addition of soy sauce makes the dish more fragrant and brings the flavors together.
7.  If you increase the seasoning ingredients by 1 and a half times and add some shirataki noodles, the dish becomes a lot more substantial! It's even better the next day after the flavors have soaked in.
