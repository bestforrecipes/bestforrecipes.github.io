Trailer park Tuna Salad is one of the most favored of recent trending foods on earth. It’s enjoyed by millions every day. It is easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. Trailer park Tuna Salad is something that I have loved my entire life. They are fine and they look wonderful.

To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook trailer park tuna salad using 10 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Trailer park Tuna Salad:

1.  Take 5 cans tuna (the ones that resemble a hockey puck)
2.  Prepare 3/4 cup mayo (approx.)
3.  Prepare 1/4 cup relish (approx.)
4.  Make ready 2 tbsp brown mustard
5.  Get 1/4 cup diced white onion
6.  Make ready to taste Salt and Pepper
7.  Make ready 1 tsp Paprika
8.  Get 1 tbsp diced garlic
9.  Make ready 2 tbsp Italian seasoning or oregano
10.  Take 1 dash Italian dressing (secret ingredient)

##### Steps to make Trailer park Tuna Salad:

1.  Open cans of tuna and drain the water. Use a fork to break up the tuna a little bit in the can. Empty them into the container of your choice. I usually mix it all right in the Tupperware I'll be using for storage.
2.  I like to add all the seasonings first onto the dry tuna. Then add the "wet" ingredients. Mix everything well with your fork. Again, the measurements here are not exact. You don't want it too wet and you also don't want it too dry. You can always add more mayo/relish/mustard, you can't take it out. So start with the amounts I've listed, then add more as you're mixing if it's too dry. It's really about your preference.
3.  After everything is mixed very well, let it sit in the fridge overnight. This is key. I do not recommend eating it right away. Everything needs time to meld together and its supposed to be eaten cold. - - When you take it out in the morning to make sandwiches, mix it again. Voilà. My world famous Trailer Park Tuna Salad. Roll that around yer mouth a'while!
