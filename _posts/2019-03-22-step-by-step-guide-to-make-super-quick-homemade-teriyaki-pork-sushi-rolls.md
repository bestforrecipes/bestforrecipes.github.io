##### Instructions to make Teriyaki Pork Sushi Rolls:

1.  Coat a pan with vegetable oil, heat, and saute the pork and garlic. Add soy sauce, sugar, and mirin, and saute until the broth evaporates.
2.  Crack an egg into a bowl, add sake, sugar, and salt, and mix thoroughly. Make the thick fried omelette with the mixture, and cut into 1.5 cm sticks (long and thin).
3.  Quickly blanch the spinach in salted hot water (not listed), drain in a sieve, rinse with cold water, and squeeze tightly.
4.  Spread out a sheet of nori seaweed on a sushi mat, and spread out 1/4 of the sushi rice thinly and evenly on top. Leave about 4 cm of seaweed for the overlap.
5.  Lay the egg, crab meat with a little space in between, and spinach at the front of the sushi roll. Squeeze a generous amount of mayonnaise in the space between the imitation crab and egg.
6.  Add the teriyaki pork on top of the squeezed mayonnaise, and roll it up.
7.  After rolling, wrap the roll in plastic wrap, and let sit for a while. I think it makes it more difficult for the roll to fall apart if you cut it through the plastic wrap.
8.  I heard that this tastes great with mustard-mayonnaise as well. That sounds nice! This is a tip from COOKPAD user "Mifu74".
