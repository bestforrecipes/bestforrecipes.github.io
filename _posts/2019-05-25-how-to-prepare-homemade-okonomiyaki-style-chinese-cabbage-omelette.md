##### The ingredients needed to make Okonomiyaki-style Chinese Cabbage Omelette:

##### Instructions to make Okonomiyaki-style Chinese Cabbage Omelette:

1.  This omelette is delicious even without bonito flakes. If you stir-fry the cabbage before cooking, it'll wilt and soften. This means that the okonomiyaki will lose its crunch.
2.  Chop the Chinese cabbage up into 1 cm pieces and slice the sausage into whatever size you prefer.
3.  Combine the sausage and cabbage with the beaten egg. If the pieces of cabbage are too big, the mixture will be difficult to mix.
4.  Cook the omelette in a frying pan that has been greased with a thin layer of oil. Allow the omelette to cook slowly without interfering.
5.  Once one side is cooked, flip the omelette over. You can cover the pan with a lid if you like, but the omelette will turn out just fine without it.
6.  Slide the omelette onto a plate and pour over some mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce to serve.
7.  If you have them, decorate the omelette with bonito flakes and red pickled ginger. It'll make the omelette look even more similar to okonomiyaki.
