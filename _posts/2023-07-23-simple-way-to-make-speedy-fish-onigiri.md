3.  Bring water to a boil, THEN add the rice. The rice will cool the water down, but be sure to keep the water at the same temp until it's simmering again. Once simmering, set the stove top heat to low and cover the pot. Check every 10 minutes until the rice is completely cooked.

5.  Assemble! Using plastic wrap, a zip lock bag, or rice ball mold, combine seasoning, rice, and fish together. After, carefully guide the mixture into a triangle shape.
6.  Remove wrap or bag and place one seaweed chip at the base (the fatter end). The seaweed will get less stiff and more moist, making it flexible enough to wrap around the rice ball’s bottom.
