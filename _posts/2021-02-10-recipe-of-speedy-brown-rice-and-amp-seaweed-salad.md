**Brown Rice &amp; Seaweed Salad**

Hello everybody, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, brown rice & seaweed salad. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Brown Rice is a whole-grain rice with the inedible outer hull removed. White rice is the same grain but has the hull, bran layer, and cereal germ removed. Red rice, gold rice, and black rice (also called purple rice) are all whole rices, but with differently pigmented outer layers.

Brown Rice & Seaweed Salad is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It is simple, it is fast, it tastes delicious. It is enjoyed by millions every day. They are nice and they look fantastic. Brown Rice & Seaweed Salad is something that I have loved my whole life.

To begin with this recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook brown rice & seaweed salad using 13 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Brown Rice & Seaweed Salad:

1.  Get brown/wild rice (I used barley and millet)
2.  Get water
3.  Take pumpkin seeds
4.  Make ready soy sauce
5.  Prepare spring onions
6.  Prepare finely sliced pickled sushi ginger or grated fresh ginger
7.  Get mirin or lemon juice
8.  Take sesame oil
9.  Make ready oil
10.  Take soy sauce,
11.  Take salt and pepper
12.  Prepare sliced nori (seaweed sheets)
13.  Take Frozen peas (if desired)

The process that produces brown rice removes only the outermost layer, the hull, of the rice kernel and is the least damaging to its nutritional value. The complete milling and polishing that converts. Slow and low is the way to go. Yes, it takes a little longer than white rice, but it's not any harder.

##### Steps to make Brown Rice & Seaweed Salad:

1.  Cook your rice or barley (I used a rice cooker)
2.  While rice is cooking roast your pumpkin seeds. Once these are roasted transfer to a bowl and pour over the soy sauce, mix and set aside to cool.
3.  Cook your peas
4.  Combine the mirin or lemon juice, sesame oil, and soy sauce, spring onion
5.  Stir all the ingredients into the rice and half the pumpkin seeds. Transfer to a serving dish.
6.  Just before serving, stir in most of the pumpkin seeds and half the nori. Scatter the remaining pumpkin seeds and nori over the top of the rice.

We have a few hacks to bump up flavor and ensure fluffy results. Manufacturers refine brown rice to make white rice, so it tends to have lower nutritional value. Is brown rice or white rice better for health? If you've ever cooked brown rice that turned out gummy, undercooked, or stuck to the bottom of the pan, join the club. Brown rice is a "good" carb, they say, and white rice is a "bad" one.
