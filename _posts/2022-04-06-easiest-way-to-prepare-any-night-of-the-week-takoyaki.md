##### Instructions to make Takoyaki:

1.  Cut the cooked Octopus into bite size pieces. Octopus is hard to find for me, so I often use cooked Prawns or Squid.
2.  Place Plain Flour, Dashi Stock, Egg and Soy Sauce in a mixing bowl and mix well. If you have a measuring cup or jag with a handle, pour the batter in them first so that it’s easier to pour the batter onto the pan.
3.  Heat the pan over high heat. When the pan is hot, use a brush to oil the pan, quite generously, and lower the heat to medium to low.
4.  Pour the batter to fill the bowls of the pan. Add 1-2 Octopus pieces in each hole and sprinkle on the Spring Onion and Pickled Ginger. Pour a little bit more batter over.
5.  When the bottom of the balls is hardened enough, turn each piece over. The batter flows out from the inside of each bowl and creates the other side of the ball. Flip the ball occasionally to cook evenly.
6.  When outside is golden, transfer onto a plate and pour Takoyaki Sauce, and other toppings. Serve immediately.
7.  \*Note: You don't have either Takoyaki Sauce, Okonomiyaki Sauce OR Tonkatsu Sauce? Don't give up. Create your own sauce by adding Soy Sauce, Ketchup and/or Oyster Sauce to BBQ sauce.
