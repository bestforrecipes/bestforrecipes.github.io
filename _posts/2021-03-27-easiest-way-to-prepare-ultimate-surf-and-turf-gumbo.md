##### Steps to make Surf and turf gumbo!:

1.  Place chicken in large pot, cover with water and bring to boil, lower heat and simmer for 45 minutes. If you boil a chicken too aggressively the meat will be tough. Low and slow yields a more tender meat. When chicken is done remove from pot and set aside (lightly covered). Skim broth and remove any bits of fat or bone. Set aside for later use.
2.  Dice all of your vegetables and place in a large bowl together. Set aside.
3.  If you are using a sausage with high fat content (such as pork), you want saute them until grease is brought out and set aside on some paper towels (underneath and on top) to drain. I use venison, which is a very lean sausage, so I skip this step.
4.  In small pot, cover 8 eggs with one inch of water and bring to boil,cook for 7 minutes then place eggs in ice water bath. When cool, peel and set aside.
5.  In a large Dutch oven, heat your vegetable oil on medium high. When it begins to ripple, drop a little bit of your flour onto it. If it immediately begins frying, your oil is ready. Add your flour 1/2 cup at a time and stir into oil until all has been used. Lower heat to medium low and stir continuously until roux is the color of milk chocolate. This takes time! Sometimes I am stirring my roux for up to 40 minutes. Store bought roux is available if you want to skip this step, I don't recommend
6.  Add all of your vegetables to the roux and continue to stir for one minute.
7.  Add the broth from your chicken and add water until it reaches 9 quarts. Raise heat to high. Your roux will not incorporate into broth until it starts to boil. Stir occasionally until this happens.
8.  Add your sausage and shrimp to boiling pot. Bring to boil again, then lower heat to simmer for 30 minutes.
9.  Add crab meat and eggs. Simmer for 10 more minutes.
10.  While gumbo is simmering, debone the chicken, add to pot and stir gently. Take pot off of heat and let it sit for 8 minutes, covered.
11.  I serve mine over rice with potato salad on the side.
