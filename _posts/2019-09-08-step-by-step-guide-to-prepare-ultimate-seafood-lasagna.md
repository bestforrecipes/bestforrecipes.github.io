##### Instructions to make Seafood lasagna:

1.  Seafood sauce: in a pan pour olive oil, add chopped onions and fine chopped garlic cloves for 10 minutes until caramelized. Then and add carrots and celery and seafood mixture for 5 minutes. Add wine and let it dry.
2.  Seafood sauce: Mix everything and add chopped tomatoes. Add salt to taste, red chili powder, dried oregano and basil, black pepper, bay leaf and sugar. Add water and bring it to boil (don't add all water from the beginning, better to check while simmering). Let slowly simmer for 90 to 120 minutes. It has to be a thin watery sauce, add broth if it ended too thick.
3.  Bechamel Sauce: melt butter in a saucepan with low flame, then add flour and mix for two minutes to cook. Add warm milk and keep whisking until creamy texture (4-5 min). Add salt, nutmeg and parmesan cheese.
4.  Prepare lasagna in a casserole pan. First pour chopped tomatoes and olive oil to keep it moist and avoid sticking. Then, layer of pasta, seafood sauce, fresh herbs, parmesan, bechamel sauce and mozzarella. Repeat 3 more layers (press a little with your hands when you add the pasta layer) and add extra cheese on top. Cover with foil (coat bottom with oil to avoid cheese sticking)

6.  Cook in the oven at 180C / 350F for 45-60min. Remove foil for the last 5-10min to broil (you can increase temperature in this last phase if your oven doesn't have broil system).
7.  Take lasagna out of oven and wait 15min before serving.
