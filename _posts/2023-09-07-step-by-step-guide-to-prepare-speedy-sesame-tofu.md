1.  You need Sesame Paste. I have tried with Tahini, but you can’t get the right flavour because Tahini is made from raw sesame seeds. Please toast sesame seeds using a sauce pan for a few minutes or until aromatic, then grind into paste using ‘Suribachi (Japanese Mortar)’ or small food processor.
2.  Place Soy Milk, Sesame Paste, Starch Flour and a pinch of Salt in a saucepan. If you use Agar Agar Powder, add it at this stage and mix well.
3.  Bring to the boil over medium low heat, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon. It should become gooey paste. Remove from heat.
4.  If you use Gelatine Powder instead of Agar Agar, sprinkle Gelatine Powder over 2 to 3 tablespoons boiling water in a small bowl and whisk until dissolved. Then whisk into the mixture at this stage.
5.  Pour the mixture into wet glasses, plastic-wrap-lined container or wet jelly moulds, then cool to set. When cool enough, place them in the fridge to set completely.
6.  Serve with ‘Wasabi & Soy Sauce’ OR ‘Miso Sauce’ which can be made by mixing 1 tablespoon Miso, 1 tablespoon Mirin and a little bit of Sugar (only if you like it sweeter), or sauce of your choice.
