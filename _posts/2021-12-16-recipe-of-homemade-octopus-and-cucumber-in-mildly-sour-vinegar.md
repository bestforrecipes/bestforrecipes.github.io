To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have octopus and cucumber in mildly sour vinegar using 6 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Octopus and Cucumber in Mildly Sour Vinegar:

1.  Take 2 Cucumbers
2.  Get 1/4 tsp Salt
3.  Prepare 150 grams Octopus
4.  Make ready 2 tbsp ☆Sugar
5.  Prepare 2 tbsp ☆Vinegar
6.  Get 2 tsp ☆ Shiro-dashi

Again, it's a matter of preference. This adds calories to the salad, and makes a heavier dressing that can dominate the fresh cucumber taste. The sour cream sauce in this cucumber salad needs some time to refrigerate so that the flavors can meld. Throw together the sour cream with the flavorings (shallot, vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper), then pop it in the fridge while you drain the cucumbers.

##### Instructions to make Octopus and Cucumber in Mildly Sour Vinegar:

1.  Combine the ingredients marked with a ☆ in a bowl and dissolve the sugar.
2.  Slice the cucumber with a slicer, and massage in some salt. Squeeze out the excess water well.
3.  If you are using sashimi grade octopus, just cut it into bite-sized bits and use as is. If your octopus is raw, make sure to boil it first.
4.  Combine everything and blend the flavours. Leaving it for about 30 minutes should be fine. Keep it in the fridge when it's done.
5.  I also tried using frozen squid. I boiled the frozen squid without thawing it and marinated it in the sauce.

Combine cucumber and onion in a clean spring-top jar. Combine the remaining ingredients, with the exception of the garlic, in a non-reactive saucepan. Stir occasionally to dissolve the sugar and salt. Peel the cucumber and slice lengthwise in quarters.
