##### Instructions to make Mike's Easy Garlic Lobster Linguine:

1.  Dethaw your pre-cooked lobster claws in fridge. Reserve all fluids within your bag for your linguine water noodle boil. Or, 1 cup seafood broth/stock.
2.  Once claws are dethawed, pour those fluids at the base of the bag into your linguine boil pot, or, add 1 cup seafood stock/broth and bring to a heavy boil. Also, add your salt and olive oil. Your linguini will soak up that sweet seafood flavor quite well!
3.  In a seperate pan, place everything in the White Alfredo Lobster Sauce section. Hold off on the lobster.
4.  Remove rubber bands from claws. One by one, place a Ziplock Bag \[or equivalent\] over the claw\[s\] - with a towel over them and break up your shells with a kitchen mallet. Break all of them and remove lobster meat.
5.  Triple check your lobster for any hidden shells. Trust me - they'll be well hidden. Rough chop your lobster meat. You'll be able to feel for additional shells during your rough chop as a fourth check. Â° Place your lobster meat into your white sauce. Heat until hot then immediately reduce to low. Remember, your lobster meat is already pre-cooked. You don't want it chewy by over cooking it.
6.  Boil your linguine for 2 minutes UNDER manufactures directions, \[usually about 10 minutes but read directions\] quickly drain completely \[do not rinse noodles\] and place in your white sauce. Place a tight fitting lid upon it and allow sauce to simmer on high for 2 to 3 minutes longer.
