##### Steps to make Sardine Umaki Rice Bowl–Also Good With Saury & Mackerel:

2.  Wipe off any moisture from the sardines with a paper towel, and coat both sides with flour. Shake off any excess.
3.  Heat oil in a frying pan, and once it's warm enough, cook both sides of the fish (I recommend cooking from the inside to prevent curling). The outside should be a bit crispy.
4.  Mix in the ☆ ingredients, then turn off the heat and shift the ingredients in the frying pan in a circular motion to mix. Place on a cutting board and cut into desired sizes.
5.  Garnish with shredded nori, sardines, sesame, and shiso on hot rice, in that order. Top with the leftover sauce in the pan and it's complete.
6.  Mackerel is also simple and tasty.

Whatever that you choose, just make sure to get the ones that come with tomato sauce though. You can always have this curry with some rice or any type of flat bread. You would want something to soak up all the curry sauce.
