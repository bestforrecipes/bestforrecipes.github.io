5.  Check back with more ideas. Fyi (having a licensed paramedical esthetic background with a passion of anything that enhances our natural beauty I'd thought you should know lol) Kale is known for the best leading skin clearing ingredient to date. Please do not substitute with Spinach as this may sound healthy as well but does cause acne.
