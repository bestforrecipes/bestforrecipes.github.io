##### Instructions to make Healthy Steamed Salted Salmon and Vegetables:

1.  Tear the cabbage into bite sizes and line the bottom of a sauce pan or deepish frying pan. Slice the core of the cabbage and use up.
2.  Slice the potatoes into 5-mm-thickness. Place on to the cabbage leaves.
3.  Loosen the enoki mushrooms and scatter atop. Place the salmon fillets. I used large salted salmon fillets.
4.  Loosen the shimeji mushrooms and scatter on top with carrot.
5.  Place the grated ginger on top and sprinkle with Japanese dashi stock powder. (If you want to refrain form salt do not add any dashi powder.)
6.  Add the water and cooking sake and cover. My pan is a special steam pan so I don't have to add any water but if you use a normal pan, add water.
7.  After bringing to a boil ,heat for about 5 minutes over a low heat. After this, turn off the heat and leave to stand with the lid on. The vegetables yield a lot of liquid like this.
8.  Check if the salmon and vegetables are cooked through and transfer onto a serving plate with a fish slice. Pour on the cooking liquid and serve.
9.  Adjust the cooking time according to the pan you use. If you have a pan with a good heat retention, cook for 5 minutes and leave to stand for 5 minutes. This is economical for fuel.
10.  If you don't have a pan with a good heat retention cook for longer and double the water amount to ensure that the ingredients are not burned.
11.  When you are busy, prepare up to Step 5 and keep the pan itself in the fridge. Add the water and sake and cook before eating.

Spray with oil using the Kitchen Spritzer and sprinkle with the Garlic & Herb Rub. Steamed Salmon is a healthy and nutritious method to prepare this delicate flavored fish. A one-inch thick salmon fillet will steam in six to eight minutes and will be moist, flavorful and delicious. If you are steaming thicker fillets, add another three or four minutes to the cooking time for every half-inch thickness of salmon. Place the vegetables and the salmon pieces, skin-side down, on the grill.
