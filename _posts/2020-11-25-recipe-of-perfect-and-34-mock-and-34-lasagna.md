You can mock both externally required/imported code, or code passed in through dependency injection. In this quick tutorial, we'll look at three different ways of creating mock objects and how they differ from each other - with Mockito and with the Spring mocking support. A mock function that supports this style is created with mockFunction. For example, to create a mock function taking a single Int argument and returning a String The @Mock annotation is alternative to Mockito.mock(classToMock).

A mock can be thought as a dummy implementation of an interface or a class which is used to Subbing is defining of what values to return when we invoke methods of a mock object. In unit test, a test double is a replacement of a dependent component It means that the mock object verifies that it (the mock object) is being used correctly by the object. @Mock will create a mock implementation for the CustomerDao. @InjectMocks will inject the mocks marked with @Mock to this instance when it is created. So when or where are these instances created? @Mock - Creates mock instance of the field it annotates.
