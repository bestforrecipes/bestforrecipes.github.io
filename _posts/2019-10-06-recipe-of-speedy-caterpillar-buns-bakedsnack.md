##### Instructions to make Caterpillar buns #bakedsnack:

1.  To make the dough
2.  In a large bowl, Put oil, butter, egg, sugar, salt, yeast and let it rest for 5 minutes.
3.  Sieve in flour, milk powder and baking powder.
4.  Knead for a good 8-10 minutes. The more you knead the softer the bread results will be.
5.  Touch a bit of oil with your fingertips and apply all over the ball of dough. Cover in a bowl and set aside for 40mins to an hour for it to double in size.
6.  To make the filling
7.  On medium heat, put a pan with some cooking oil. Add onion and all the spices and sautÃ© for 2 minutes.
8.  Add potatoes, carrots, peas and capsicum. Add 1/2 cup water and bring the veggies to boil. Cook until the veggies are cooked through and the water has evaporated.
9.  To make the buns - - Divide the dough into 10 sections. Start rolling each one into an oval shape, about 1/4 inch or less thickness. Brush with butter, then cut strips about a third of the way into the oval on one of the longer sides of the rolled out dough.
10.  Add your filling on the opposite side of where the strips have been cut. Fold the dough over the filling to enclose it, then roll gently all the way to the end. The strips will cover teh top of the bun and give it a pretty finish. Try and pinch the ends of the strips under the dough so they do not uncurl or open up during baking.
11.  Place on a greased tray and repeat with the rest of the balls of dough. Cover with a light kitchen towel and allow the buns to rest for about 30 minutes to allow them to expand again slightly.
12.  When ready to bake, preheat the oven at 180C. Brush some egg wash and sprinkly sesame seeds. Bake for about 18-20 minutes or until the buns are done and golden.
13.  Remove and brush them with some butter. Keep them covered with a kitchen towel to retain their softness until time for serving. - - ENJOY ðŸŒ¹
