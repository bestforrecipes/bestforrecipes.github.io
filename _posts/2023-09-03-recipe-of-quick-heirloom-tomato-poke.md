##### The ingredients needed to make Heirloom Tomato Poke:

1.  Prepare 1/2 cup soy sauce
2.  Prepare 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
3.  Take 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds
4.  Prepare 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
5.  Prepare 1 tsp grated ginger
6.  Take 1 tsp crushed garlic

I'll let you in on a little secret: I never liked fresh tomatoes. Until, that is, I had my first heirloom tomato. Reisetomate tomato plants are ancient plants in the nightshade family, closely aligned with peppers and eggplants. They purportedly originated in early Peruvian civilization.

##### Instructions to make Heirloom Tomato Poke:

1.  Combine the first 6 ingredients.
2.  Cut up the tomatoes. I like big, non-uniform chunks of tomato for this dish.
3.  Toss the soy mixture with the tomatoes.
4.  Toast the nori. You can do this by waving a sheet of nori over a heat source until you feel it stiffen. It's quite noticeable when it sort of dries up and turns a bit crispy. Toasting just improves the texture and flavor of the nori.
5.  Now, take your 2 sheets of toasted nori back to back and fold them like a hot dog bun. Repeat this so that you have a long strip of nori. Since it's toasted, it should break at the folds, so you'll have 8 strips of nori in a stack. Grab some kitchen scissors. holding the nori over the tomatoes, cut about 2mm off of the end of the short side. Keep doing this until the nori is all turned into these little thin strips. You can kinda see what it's supposed to look like in the picture.
6.  Time to serve. But don't forget to check the flavor and see if it needs any small adjustments.

Heirloom tomatoes add interest and great taste to summer dishes. It is quite economical to grow your own and even to do so organically. Heirloom tomatoes must be open-pollinated and must not be.
