##### Steps to make Our Family's Recipe For Fluffy Light Okonomiyaki with Tofu:

1.  Put tofu into a bowl and mash with a whisk. Add the okonomiyaki flour, water, and egg, and mix well. Rest for a while in the refrigerator.
2.  Chop up the cabbage roughly. Squeeze out well to remove excess moisture. Chop up the green onions also.
3.  Preheat an electric griddle to 390F/200C.
4.  Put 1 serving (about 80g) of the batter into a small bowl with about 120 g of chopped cabbage, a little tenkasu, green onion, and red pickled ginger. It will taste better if you have more cabbage than batter.
5.  Mix with a spoon to incorporate air into the batter. Do this one pancake serving at a time.
6.  The key to a soft, airy fluffy okonomiyaki is to mix up the batter and vegetable while incorporating air just before cooking.
7.  Pour the batter onto the electric griddle. Use the edge of the spoon to gently spread the pancake out so that it's about 2 cm thick. Cook for about 3 minutes.
8.  After 3 minutes, spread 3 slices of pork on top. When the edges of the pan cake start to dry out, flip the pancake over.
9.  Don't press down on the pancake after flipping. If you do so, the pancake will become flat and lose its light airiness. Only use the spatula to neaten the edges.
10.  After about 4 minutes, flip the pancake over again and cook for another 3 minutes or so.
11.  Put on okonomiyaki sauce, ao-nori seaweed powder, and bonito flakes, and it's done.
