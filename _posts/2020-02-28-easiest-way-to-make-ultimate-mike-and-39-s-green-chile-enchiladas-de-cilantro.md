##### Instructions to make Mike's Green Chile Enchiladas De Cilantro:

1.  Add everything in the Meat Section to a pot and boil covered until chicken breasts are fully cooked. Usually about 35-40 minutes. Puncture chicken with knife to check for doneness. Clear fluid only should be seen when it's done. Drain and discard broth. Always keep chicken away from other kitchen items you're using to avoid any potential cross contamination.
2.  Mix everything in the Enchilada Filler Section \[except for items listed as, "additional garnishes"\] and refrigerate until needed. Though pull 2 cups filling from that and set to the side in fridge as well.
3.  Heat 18 or 24 8" Flour Tortillas just slightly in microwave if you're ready to assemble.
4.  Add 2 tablespoons of filling to the center of a tortilla and smear from end to end. Don't add more as these will over expand during baking! Add desired amounts of shreadded chicken atop of filling. Loosely roll and place enchiladas seam side down in an oven safe dish.
5.  Smear your 2 cups additional filling evenly between trays on their tops. Garnish trays with listed items, additional chicken and 1 cup Cilantro. Reserve the rest of Cilantro for service. Add a few dashes of Cumin to the finished tops and prepare to bake uncovered.
6.  Bake at 350° for 40 minutes uncovered in sprayed or nonstick pans. Sprayed disposable pans work best for cleanup.
7.  Serve immediately with Green Chile Salsa, Chile Verde Sauce, Bueno Green Chiles, additional fresh Cilantro, Sour Cream and/or Avocado slices. Margaritas go great with these little babies as well! - - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/367872-mikes-easy-chile-verde-sauce](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/367872-mikes-easy-chile-verde-sauce) - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/340607-mikes-roast-ur-own-chiles-20-recipes](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/340607-mikes-roast-ur-own-chiles-20-recipes)
