##### Instructions to make Cannelloni:

3.  Add meat and brown. Drain excess oil.
4.  Put meat mixture in large bowl. Add spinach, Parmesan cheese, cream and eggs. Season with salt, pepper, and oregano.
5.  Make Bechamel: melt butter, add flour, blend, slowly add milk, cook slowly while stirring constantly until thick, season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
6.  Stuff into precooked shells and place into a casserole dish that has a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom. Pour Bechamel sauce over cannelloni, top with a thin layer of marinara. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

Of course, it has a generous layer of more sauce and cheese to top it all off. Serve the cannelloni with extra tomato sauce from the baking dish and garnish with fresh basil. Cannelloni has to be smothered generously with sauce to ensure there's enough liquid for the dry pasta tubes to absorb and cook in the oven. The most common sauce is a tomato pasta sauce which is what I use. Add cream, roma tomatoes, cheese, dry herbs and basil.
