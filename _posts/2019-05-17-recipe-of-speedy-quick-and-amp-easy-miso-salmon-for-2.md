##### Steps to make Quick & Easy Miso Salmon for 2:

1.  Take the salmon out of the fridge and let it come up to room temp before cooking (20 to 30 minutes).
2.  Preheat the oven to 425F.
3.  Line an oven proof dish that will fit both your salmon fillets with aluminum foil. This makes for super easy cleanup. (I used one of those Pyrex pie dishes.)
4.  Rub the salmon fillets on all surfaces, skin side included, with the tablespoon of oil, and place them, skin side up, in the foil-lined baking dish.
5.  Mix all the glaze ingredients together until the miso is fully incorporated and the brown sugar is dissolved.
6.  Pour the glaze over the salmon, and bake for 10 minutes.
7.  Optional step: If you want to crisp up the skin a bit, turn the oven to broil, and put the salmon under the broiler for 30 seconds to a minute, checking on it at the 30 second mark. Sweet glazes can burn quickly under the intense heat of a broiler.
8.  The way I tell if the salmon is done is to give the center a gentle press down with my index finger as if I'm going to push into the fish about 1/4 of an inch. If it stays indented, it's undercooked. If it's resistant to any indentation, it's probably overcooked. But if it gives to the push and springs right back up, it's done.
9.  Garnish with chopped or julienned green onions and serve with steamed rice. Enjoy!
