##### Steps to make Mochi, Cabbage, and Egg Okonomiyaki - Ultra Easy!:

1.  Slice the mochi into 2-3mm. I got 15 slices out of 1 cake.
2.  Scatter the mochi in a non-stick pan (18 cm diameter). Don't let the mochi slices overlap. No oil necessary.
3.  Heat over medium heat. After 1 minute, the mochi will start to puff up a bit. The mochi pieces can get stuck together or stay apart with gaps in between at this point.
4.  Top with the shredded cabbage, and pour in a beaten egg. Drizzle water along the perimeter of the pan, cover with a lid and cook over medium heat for 3 minutes.
5.  When the cabbage has wilted, it's done. Take a peek at the bottom by lifting up the pancake with a spatula. If the mochi is crispy, it's good.
6.  Turn off the heat, and drizzle on the mayonnaise and sauce while it's still in the pan. They'll sizzle up a bit and add more flavor.
7.  Top with bonito flakes and it's done! It tastes like a proper okonomiyaki.
