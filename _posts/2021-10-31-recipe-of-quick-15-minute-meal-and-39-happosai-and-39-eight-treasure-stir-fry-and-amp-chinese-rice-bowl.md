##### Steps to make 15 Minute Meal: 'Happosai' Eight Treasure Stir-fry & Chinese Rice Bowl:

7.  Addendum 1: Rehydrate dried wakame seaweed. Combine it with sesame oil, soy sauce, Japanese leek, and sesame seeds. Make a bowl of soup with Chinese soup stock, and add the wakame mixture to make wakame soup.
8.  Addendum 2: Divide julienned ginger and thinly sliced ginger into small portions, cover with cling film, and keep them in the freezer. They will come in handy since you can use the thinly sliced ginger to make simmered fish, and you can use the julienned ginger to make this dish.
