##### The ingredients needed to make Inari Sushi with Nuts and Dried Fruits:

1.  Make ready 180 ml Uncooked white rice
2.  Prepare 50 grams Dried cranberries
3.  Make ready 3 Dried apricots

##### Instructions to make Inari Sushi with Nuts and Dried Fruits:

1.  I used these pine nuts, apricots and cranberries. I like the packaging, which clearly lists the nutritional information of the contents.
2.  Wash 1 rice cooker cup worth of rice, and add a bit less water than usual. Put in the dried fruit, sake, and dashi stock granules.
3.  I used these store-bought inari sushi skins.
4.  Add the pine nuts to the freshly cooked rice, squeeze in the juice of one sudachi, and mix. The apricots will melt a little and add a subtle color to the rice.
5.  I wanted to use the sourness of the sudachi juice only, but I found that vinegar is needed after all. Add 1 tablespoon of vinegar and mix.
6.  Chop up the daikon radish sprouts and mix them into the rice. Stuff the rice into the inari sushi skins, and they're done.
7.  Bonus: I didn't have enough of the premade inari sushi skins, so I chopped up 2 of them and mixed them with the remaining rice for a chirashi sushi-style dish.
