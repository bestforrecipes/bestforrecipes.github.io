##### Instructions to make Parchment garlic butter with thyme salmon:

1.  Pre heat oven to 350 f(180 c)
2.  Fold parchment paper in half, make sure you have enough parchment paper to fold and make a pocket for all the ingredients. The pocket should have enough room and not be tight
3.  In a small bowl combine the garlic,butter and thyme. Spread the potato’s on one half of the parchment paper and pour over have of the butter mixture.
4.  Lay the salmon over the potato’s and drizzle with the rest of the butter, season lightly with salt and pepper. I like to add a couple of slices of Lemmon on top of the salmon along with some sprigs of thyme (optional)
5.  Fold the parchment paper over the salmon and clinch the edges starting at one end all the way round to form a sealed pocket
6.  Place on a baking tray and put in the pre heated oven for approx 30min or until the internal temperature of the salmon reaches 145 f (63 c) serve and enjoy

In a hot oven, melt butter in a skillet until it sizzles, add the salmon, flip, remove the skin, then allow to roast a few minutes more. Don't be afraid to play with herb and fat combinations: parsley, chervil or dill work well with butter; thyme, basil or marjoram. Basting salmon in a mixture of butter, garlic and thyme make this salmon utterly irresistable. Season salmon generously with salt and pepper. Next, pour oil into pan and place salmon skin-side down; adjust heat as necessary if bottom begins to brown too quickly.
