To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have lettuce sushi rolls using 6 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Lettuce Sushi Rolls:

1.  Take 900 grams Vinegar rice (sushi rice)
2.  Make ready 4 sheets Toasted nori seaweed
3.  Prepare 4 to 5 leaves Lettuce
4.  Take 4 stick Imitation crab sticks
5.  Prepare 1 Mayonnaise
6.  Take 1 use 2 medium sized eggs and sugar (to taste) Japanese tamagoyaki omelette

##### Steps to make Lettuce Sushi Rolls:

1.  Prepare the sushi rice with your preferred seasoning. This time, I used a shortcut and made mine with powdered sushi vinegar.
2.  Cook a mildly sweet tamagoyaki omelette, adjusting the amount of sugar to your liking. Once it has cooled down, cut the omelette into long, thin strips.
3.  Take the crab sticks out of their packaging and shred the lettuce into easy to handle sizes. Rinse both with water and dry off any excess moisture with a paper towel. Once you've rearranged the ingredients to roll, you're all set.
4.  Let a sheet of nori seaweed rest on a sushi mat, evenly spread about 220 g of sushi rice on top. 220 g is a guideline, but beware of using too much rice. If you leave around 1 cm of open space on the far side of the nori, it'll make the rolling easier.
5.  In order, lay out the lettuce, followed by the crab sticks, omelette, and finally the mayonnaise.
6.  Add another layer of lettuce on top. Then, as with any other sushi roll, start working it into a roll from the bottom.
7.  Keep the shape of the rolls by letting them sit with their tails of nori on the bottom.
8.  Cut the rolls into your preferred size, plate, and serve!
