##### The ingredients needed to make Plump and Firm Shrimp with Ginger Mayonnaise Sauce:

2.  Take 1 tbsp Bicarbonate of soda
3.  Take 1 Egg white
4.  Prepare 2 tbsp Katakuriko
5.  Make ready Sauce
6.  Take 3 tbsp Mayonnaise
7.  Make ready 2 tbsp Milk
8.  Prepare 1 tsp Honey
9.  Prepare 1 tsp Kombu tea
10.  Make ready 1 dash of each Grated garlic, the juice from grated ginger

The top countries of suppliers are India, China, and Malaysia. The simple sauce is made with tomato ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. There's lots of delicious umami flavour, and the aroma is irresistible. Using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt.

##### Instructions to make Plump and Firm Shrimp with Ginger Mayonnaise Sauce:

1.  Defrost the frozen shrimp in water with bicarbonate of soda (baking soda). When defrosted, cut diagonally into the stomach to devein, and smash with the side of a knife lightly.
2.  If the shrimp have their tails on, rub the pointed part of each tail with the side of your knife as if you were sharpening it to squeeze out the water. If you don't do this the shrimp will spit oil in the heated pan, so be careful!
3.  Mix the egg white with the shrimp. Rub the white into the shrimp with your fingertips. The shrimp will absorb the egg white and become really plump and juicy.
4.  Add katakuriko to the shrimp and mix to coat. If you want the batter to be on the thick side, add an egg yolk too.
5.  Deep fry the shrimp in oil. Don't over-fry or they'll get tough. If they just turn red they're OK!
6.  I tried pan frying the shrimp too. It was a success - there wasn't much difference in frying the coating, compared to deep frying. Be careful not to let the batter fall off when you turn the shrimp over.
7.  Make the sauce. Mix all the sauce ingredients together, microwave for about 20 seconds, then mix again.
8.  Coat the shrimp with the mayonnaise sauce and it's done! I deep fried asparagus with it. You could also add octopus or potatoes.
9.  The shrimp are also great with pea shoots that have been blanched for about 20 seconds! I recommend it.

Once paper towels absorb excess oil, place shrimp on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Although not a traditional Dominican recipe, Shrimp with Coconut and Ginger Sauce is inspired by the classic cuisine from Samana. I cannot understand why this isn't available everywhere. Hands-down the best mayo alternative on the market. Season the shrimps with salt, dust them with flour, and roll them in eggs then in panko.
