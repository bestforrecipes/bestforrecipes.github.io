##### Steps to make Goya Chanpuru, Okinawan Cuisine:

1.  First, prepare the sauce for goya chanpuru. Mix sake, soy sauce, mirin, salt,bonito stock all together.
2.  Hull the goya and cut it in the half lengthwise and take all seeds with a spoon or your fingers and discard them.
3.  Slice goya thin like the shape of letter C. Goya is a bitter melon. (If you do not like this bitterness, put the sliced goya in a water with salt and soak it for 10 minutes. I don't do this because I like this bitter taste)
4.  Wrap the extra firm tofu with 4 kitchen papers and microwave it for 1 minutes. This is for removing some of the water from the tofu so it makes a good crispy tofu.
5.  Prepare the bacon while microwaving the tofu. Cut the bacon in 5 cm length.

7.  Take the tofu out from the microwave and cut it into large cubes.
8.  Heat the large frying pan, add the olive oil, and cook the tofu till they brown.

10.  Put the sesame oil to the heated pan and add the bacon.
11.  Add the goya to the pan after the bacon is almost cooked. Mix well and continue stirring until the goya becomes wilted.
12.  Add the tofu and mix gently. Be careful not to scramble the tofu.
13.  Beat the eggs.
14.  Add the beaten egg and pour the sauce from step 1. When the egg is cooked, goya chanpuru is ready to be served!
15.  Add katsuobushi if you'd like! I always add one pack of katsuobushi to the goya chanpuru. This is available in an Asian market.
