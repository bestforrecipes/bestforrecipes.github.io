3.  Choose a sunny day, spread out the mushrooms on a drying net or on a flat sieve, and put them in a sunny, well ventilated location to dry. Turn them over halfway through so that they dry evenly.
4.  Drying time: Sliced or finely shredded king oyster mushrooms will be semi-dried in 1/2 to 1 day, and fully dried (for long term storage) in 2 to 3 days.
