Makizushi. (巻き寿司, Maki, Maki Rolls, Rolled Sushi, Sushi Roll, Maki-Zushi, Maki Zushi). Makizushi, meaning rolled sushi, is probably the most famous sushi variety. A variety of ingredients such as sashimi, boiled shrimp, baked eggs, and cucumber are cut and/or sliced. Maki sushi or Maki zushi (pronounced as mah-kee-zoo-shee) as it is called in Japanese, is one of my favorites when it comes to oriental cuisine.

##### Instructions to make Maki-zushi:

1.  How To Roll:
2.  Place a sheet of Nori on Makisu (bamboo mat). You can try with Plastic Food Wrap or Foil if you don’t have Makisu.
3.  Spread out cooled Sushi Rice on the Nori sheet. You need to leave some empty space at the end.
4.  Place some filling on the rice, then start to roll. Lift the nearest end of Makisu and fold over rice and filling, matching the end of the spread rice to the other end, then press. Pull the Makisu end up and roll it, pressing it a couple of times.
5.  Once the Maki-zushi has been rolled, it is cut into bite sized pieces with a sharp knife. The knife becomes very sticky, so you need to wipe it frequently with a wet cloth or paper towel.
6.  Tip: I have found that Electric Knife is a great tool to cut Sushi Rolls.
7.  It is much easier to make thin Maki-zushi rolls than thick ones. To do this, you may have to cut your Nori sheets in half, and use one filling for each roll.
