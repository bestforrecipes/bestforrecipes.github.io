Octopus is a tasty, healthy, lean seafood that can sometimes be tough when cooked. By tenderizing the meat before cooking and then cooking the octopus in its own juices, you can break down the tough muscle fibers and preserve the juiciness of the meat, resulting in a moist and tender meal that isn't. For the salad, place the potatoes into a saucepan of salted water and bring to the boil. Then put the garlic and agretti in a large bowl with the cucumber and chicories.
