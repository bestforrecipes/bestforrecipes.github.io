##### Steps to make Warm Vegetables with Oyster Flavored Meat Miso:

1.  \[For the oyster meat miso\] Mince the garlic, ginger and onion.
2.  Heat oil in a pan and saute the garlic and ginger until fragrant.
3.  Add the onion and saute until soft. Add the ground meat and cook until crumbly.
4.  When the meat is cooked through, add the ☆ ingredients, and simmer over low heat for 3 to 5 minutes while stirring.
5.  Transfer to a serving dish. The oyster flavored meat miso is done.
6.  \[For the warm vegetables\] Wrap the potatoes individually in plastic wrap, and microwave until soft.
7.  Remove the plastic wrap as soon as they're done, and peel while still hot (you can do this easily with your hands). Cut into 4 pieces. I used young potatoes, so I left the skins on.
8.  Peel a carrot and cut into bite sized pieces. Wrap in layers of moistened paper towels and microwave on a plate.
9.  When the carrot pieces are soft, transfer onto another plate. Microwave the kabocha squash, daikon radish, cabbage, snow peas, and eggplant in the same way.
10.  Arrange the vegetables on a serving plate with the meat miso on the side, and it's done! Spoon the sauce over the vegetables to eat.
11.  You can steam or boil the vegetables instead of microwaving. The eggplants could be grilled. I recommend using lotus roots, bamboo shoots, or boiled eggs.
12.  To cook the snow peas, peel off the fibrous strings, rub with a little salt before microwaving, then soak in cold water to stop the cooking. This will keep the luscious green color of the peas.

Miso Paste: this adds so much beautiful umami flavor! Either white or chickpea miso works here - I typically have chickpea miso on hand. Clean the mushrooms, cut the mushrooms into slices.
