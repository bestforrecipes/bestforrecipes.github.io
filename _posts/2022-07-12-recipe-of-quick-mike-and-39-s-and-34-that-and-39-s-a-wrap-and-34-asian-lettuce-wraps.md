##### Steps to make Mike's, "That's A Wrap!" Asian Lettuce Wraps:

1.  Medium heat fry all meat ingredients except for 1/4 cup fresh Cilantro, 1/4 teaspoon Chinese 5 Spice and 1/3 cup Beef Broth. Keep hamburger in larger chunks if possible. Be careful not to burn your garlic.
2.  Once hamburger is cooked, there should be no reason to drain any fat since you're using a 93% - 7% meat blend. This, "no drain," hamburger is also important since if you were to drain it, you'd loose the majority of your spices and smaller ingredients through your strainer.
3.  Frying at a higher heat, add 1/3 cup Beef Broth, 1/4 cup fresh Cilantro and 1/4 tsp Chinese 5 Spice, \[you can add more 5 spice if you enjoy a stronger flavor\] stir well and steam everything together with a tight fitting lid. Steam for approximately 5 minutes. You may need additional Beef Broth at the steam completion. You'll want a moist \[not dripping\] consistency to your meat mixture.
4.  After frying, plate up hamburger meat mixture in a serving bowl and set to the side.
5.  Chop all wrap filler vegetables, plate and chill.
6.  De-thaw shrimp in cool water.
7.  Paper towel dry shrimp.
8.  Add 2 tablespoons fish sauce to shrimp and add crushed Cilantro, powdered garlic and onion powder. Mix gently and well.
9.  Place shreadded cabbage in a seperate serving dish and pile miniature chilled shrimp atop cabbage.
10.  To prepare wraps, place warm meat atop chilled lettuce, then add any vegetable wrap toppings you and your guests may desire. Lastly, add additional Sriracha Chili Sauce, Fish Sauce, Hot Mustard, Soy Sauce, Peanut Sauce or your own homemade Thai Sweet Chili Sauce.
11.  Since you already have these ingredients on hand, why not make your own Thai Sweet & Spicy Chili Sauce? This is a recipe you can either fine chop by hand, \[better\] or puree in a blender to save some time.

THAI SWEET & SPICY RED CHILI SAUCE - - \[makes approximately 2 cups sauce\] - - Ingredients: - - \* 7 Large Garlic Cloves \[crushed & finely minced\] - - \* 2 Small Birds Eye or Serrano Peppers \[deseeded - finely minced\] - - \* 1 Small Jalapeño \[deseeded - finely minced\] - - \[ \* always wear gloves when working with peppers \* \] - - \* 2 teaspoon Sriracha Chili Sauce \[for flavor & color\] - - \* 1 - 1/2 tablespoons Crushed Red Pepper Flakes - - \* 1 tablespoon Fine Minced Ginger - - \* 1/4 cup Rice Wine Vinegar - - \* 1 tablespoon Thai Kitchen Premium Fish Sauce - - \* 2/3 to 3/4 cup Granulated Sugar - - \* 2/3 cup Water - - Directions: - - Boil ingredients for 5 - 7 minutes or until Red Pepper Flakes soften. Once boiled, mix these two ingredients very well in a separate, much smaller bowl: - - \* 1-1/2 tablespoons Cornstarch - \* 2 tablespoons Tap Water - - Add the cornstarch mixture slowly into your simmering chili sauce.
