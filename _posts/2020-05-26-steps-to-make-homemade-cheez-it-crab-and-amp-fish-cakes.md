Cheez-Its have been on my must make list for a long time. Homemade cheez its will puff up and expand slightly as they bake. In order to get crispy crackers, there I did make one small adjustment. I noticed on the ingredient list on the Cheez-it box they had.

##### Instructions to make Cheez It Crab & Fish Cakes:

1.  Process the Cheez It's into a breadcrumb-like consistency.
2.  Add everything into a bowl, season and combine with eggs.
3.  Put a little flour on the cutting board so things don’t get messy. I took the lid of a jar, rubbed a little oil in it and molded the cakes in there to get a consistent shape. Place, don’t toss, into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown and crispy, flipping occasionally, but not frequently.
4.  Allow oil to drain. Best served immediately with the condiment of your choice.
