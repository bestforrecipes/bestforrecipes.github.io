##### Instructions to make Sautéed Spicy Konnyaku Seasoned with Oyster Sauce, Mayonnaise, and Bonito Flakes:

1.  Rub the konnyaku with your hand (or pound with a rolling pin) to soften. Once it's soft, use a knife to cut a fine lattice pattern on the surface. (If too much trouble, omit this step.)

5.  Dry roast the konnyaku from Step 3 in a frying pan. Add oil to the frying pan, then add de-seeded red chili pepper, and sauté well.
