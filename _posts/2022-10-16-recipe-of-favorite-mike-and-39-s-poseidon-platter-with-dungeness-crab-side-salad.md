##### Steps to make Mike's Poseidon Platter With Dungeness Crab Side Salad:

1.  Pictured is the bulk of what you'll need for 2.5 servings. If choosing to steam your own legs - steam with lemon, garlic and white wine. When you can smell your legs - they're done. The Dungeness Crab will take 7 to 8 minutes per pound if choosing to steam. More seafood was served but this was all my students could fit into frame.
2.  Start your corn cobs. Add equal parts milk and water. Milk adds sweetness to corn. Add enough fluid to cover your corn. Also, add your butter. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Watch your pot as the milk can cause it foam up and overflow.
3.  Make your marinade and coat all seafood generously with it. Not much is needed.
4.  Scewer your Jumbo Shrimp, marinate and refrigerate. Also, add a few dashes of lemon pepper to your shrimp.
5.  It's time to grill! Clean grill, spray with non stick spray and heat. Here you're only heating your King Crab Legs and Dungeness Crab. Try to keep your temp at 400¬∞ However, you'll be grilling your shrimp. Over direct heat, grill for 5 to 7 minutes turning occasionally until shrimp is pink on the outside and opaque on the inside..
6.  Gently heat your garlic Kerrygold butter.
7.  Plate seafood hot with lemon wedges to the side with plenty of napkins.
8.  Since you have all of your butters out at room temperature, consider serving fresh, warm crispy breads. Also, consider a honey butter. It's a great contrast to the saltiness of your seafood and other butters. I've got a great honey butter recipe under my profile if interested. ‚ò∫
9.  Pull your top shells from your Dungeness Crabs and clean. Boil for two minutes.
10.  A pulled and cleaned top shell from crab pictured.
11.  The inside of your cleaned shell pictured that's been boiled for 2 minutes. You do have the option of leaving what we call, "The Mustard," within the shell but, I warn you - you'd better like the crazy taste of fishy if you do! üê¨
12.  Create your crab salad by chopping your vegetables and adding your other chilled ingredients. See recipe above. Mix well.
13.  Pack your shell with your craby chilled rich goodness! Garnish with fresh parsley, fresh ground black pepper and lemon wedges Enjoy!
14.  Check this out. my students even bought their moms a special pink fragrant rose at the end of their meal. How stinking sweet was that?! I swear - so sweet I darned near got a cavity!
