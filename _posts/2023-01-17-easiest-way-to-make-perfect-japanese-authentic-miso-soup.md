Traditionally, miso soup begins with a broth called "dashi," made by soaking seaweed such as kombu in water and cooking. Awase-miso sits in the middle from both a colour and saltiness perspective. Most miso paste you can buy at supermarkets outside Japan are awase-miso and I think that this is the most commonly used miso in Japan as well. Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soy-based soup made from a stock called dashi, miso paste, and various additional ingredients such as seaweed or tofu. As well as selling a variety of great-tasting miso pastes, Hikari Miso also sell instant miso soups, inari tofu wraps, harusame noodle soups, and other authentic, traditional Japanese foods.
