##### The ingredients needed to make Perfectly Round Takoyaki With Crisp Outsides and Creamy Insides:

1.  Take 4 tentacles Octopus (sashimi grade)

5.  Pour in plenty of batter!
6.  Add the pieces of octopus. If they are too large, the batter will spill out of the griddle.
7.  Flip them over halfway and wait. Do not flip them over completely.
8.  Once they are perfectly round, they're done.

For vegetables, steam-roasting ensures that the insides are tender, creamy and soft—velvety, even—before the outsides are blackened.
