Inari Sushi is a popular dish in Japan along with nigiri sushi (nigirizushi - hand-pressed sushi that you find at sushi trains). It is particularly popular among children. I mentioned in my post Quick Inari Sushi (Inarizushi) that there are two different shapes of Inarizushi - squarish oval shape and triangle shape. Prepare sushi rice ahead of time.
