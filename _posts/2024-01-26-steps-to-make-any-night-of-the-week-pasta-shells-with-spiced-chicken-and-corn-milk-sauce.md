##### Steps to make Pasta shells with spiced chicken and corn milk sauce:

1.  Empty the can of corn into a blender and blitz 1 minute until pureed. Pour the corn mash into a fine mesh sieve and let the milk drain into a bowl. Use a spoon to push as much milk as possible from the mash, then discard the pulp.
2.  Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. While you wait for the water to boil and the pasta to cook, proceed with the chicken and sauce.
3.  Season the chicken breast with salt, pepper and cayenne. Add a splash of veg oil to a large pan on medium-high heat and sear the chicken for 5 minutes per side until browned. Remove the chicken to a plate and wipe out the pan.

Drain the pasta (remember to reserve a cup of the pasta water) and toss it with the sauce. Add pasta water a few tablespoons at a time if the sauce is too thick.
6.  Stir in the frozen corn and let cook a final 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the basil just before serving.

Boil pasta in lightly salted water. Fry chicken in canola until lightly browned, set aside. In large pot sauté garlic in butter or margarine, do not brown. Add flour, salt, pepper, and nutmeg to garlic and butter or margarine and mix to form a roux. Slowly add milk, whisking to prevent lumps.
