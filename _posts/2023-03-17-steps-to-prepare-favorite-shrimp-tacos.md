I pulled half when the shrimp were still cold and then the rest when the shrimp were REALLY hot from the griddle, sometimes my decisions make no sense.
2.  I used soft tacos and stacked the yummies like this: sweet corn salad from a previous recipe post (you can just chop cucumber, tomato, onion, jalapeno, and throw in sweet corn), shrimp, cheese of your choice, ranch dressing, sriracha sauce, sprinkle of lime juice. Wrap it up and eat!
