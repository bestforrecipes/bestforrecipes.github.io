To get started with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have nikudofu - simmered meat and tofu using 7 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Nikudofu - Simmered Meat and Tofu:

1.  Get 200 grams Australian beef (thinly sliced chuck roll)
2.  Get 200 grams Tofu
3.  Make ready 1 Onion
4.  Get 1 tbsp of each ☆Soy sauce, sake, mirin, sugar
5.  Take 1 tsp Bonito or kombu based dashi stock granules
6.  Prepare 1 dash Sashimi soy sauce
7.  Get 1 Shredded white part of a leek and/or edamame (for garnish)

Cut the leek diagonally and the radish into thick quater-rounds. Nikujaga quite literally translates to "meat and potatoes" - niku means "meat" and jaga means "potatoes" in Japanese. It's a comfort food and the Japanese version of beef stew. The beef in Nikujaga is added more for flavor than substance.

##### Instructions to make Nikudofu - Simmered Meat and Tofu:

1.  Cut the onion in half lengthwise, then cut into 6 pieces crosswise into six pieces. Cut the half block of tofu into 6 pieces. If the beef slices are too big, cut into bite-sized pieces.
2.  Combine the soy sauce, sake, mirin and sugar into a frying pan with 100 ml of water, and put in the onion and tofu in one layer. Cook over medium heat until boiling, lower the heat to low and cover with a lid.
3.  This is the star of this dish, the meat. Inexpensive Aussie beef.
4.  When the onion turns translucent, add the beef. I just threw it in all together, but you should wave each slice around shabu-shabu style in the cooking liquid as you add it, or you may get one big clump of meat stuck together.
5.  If it bothers you, skim off the scum. Add the green onion to finish, turn off the heat, then add a little sashimi soy sauce (I think about 1 teaspoon).
6.  I garnished it with edamame. If you don't have any sashimi soy sauce, just use more regular soy sauce. That last addition of soy sauce makes the dish more fragrant and brings the flavors together.
7.  If you increase the seasoning ingredients by 1 and a half times and add some shirataki noodles, the dish becomes a lot more substantial! It's even better the next day after the flavors have soaked in.

This is a real workhorse of the Japanese home kitchen. We are making nutritious, well-balanced Niku Dofu, a sukiyaki-style simmered dish with a large amount of tofu.
