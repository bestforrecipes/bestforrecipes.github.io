**Seaside mackerel**

Hello everybody, it’s me, Dave, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, seaside mackerel. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Seaside mackerel is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It is appreciated by millions daily. It is simple, it’s fast, it tastes delicious. Seaside mackerel is something that I have loved my entire life. They are fine and they look wonderful.

And there I was, cooking samphire to serve with fish for years, enjoying it thoroughly, but never once did it cross my mind to do something else with it - like stuff it INSIDE the fish. Seaside recipes: mackerel pasty, elderflower jelly and creme fraiche ice cream. Mark Sargeant's simple summer food recipes.

To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook seaside mackerel using 14 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Seaside mackerel:

6.  Take 1 anchovy fillet, drained and chopped, or a small squeeze of anchovy paste

The ocean has warmed up in recent weeks and it sure has brought the summer species. Fluke, Small Blues, Spanish Mackerel, Rays, Sharks, and some Kingfish. Fluke has been the game in town though! All you need is Gulp and bucktails.

##### Steps to make Seaside mackerel:

1.  Rinse and pat dry the mackerel fillets, try to remove most of the pin bones but leave the back and skin intact, so that the fillets hold together.
2.  Whiz all the stuffing ingredients in a blender to make a paste, add a little water if it doesn’t come together.
3.  Open up the mackerel fillets, skin side down, on a chopping board. Spread a generous amount of the stuffing on half of each mackerel, then close with the other half on top. prepare a few lengths of kitchen string and tie the fillets together in three or four places each along the length. Chill for an hour or so.
4.  Heat up the grill to medium. Brush the mackerels with a little oil and cook on the grill rack for 4-5 minutes on each side. If the fish is on the large side, give the backs a short blast too turning it onto the cut, stuffed side.
5.  Prepare the sauce: heat the butter in a small pan until it starts to turn brown, take it off the heat and add the lemon and lime juice. Stir in the pressed garlic and the parsley. Spoon it over the fish and serve with some lightly cooked greens.

I also want to mention on how good the crabbing in the bay is right now. As mackerel is quite an oily fish, it's nice to have clean citrus flavours to cut the oil. This would be nice with a dollop of horseradish cream and a grapefruit salsa. Your fishmonger will fillet mackerel if you ask. Put smoked mackerel at the heart of this wholesome salad, packed with crunchy apple and vibrant beetroot.
