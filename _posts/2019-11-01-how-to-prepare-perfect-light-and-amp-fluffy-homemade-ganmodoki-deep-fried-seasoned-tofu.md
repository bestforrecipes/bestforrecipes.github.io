##### Instructions to make Light & Fluffy Homemade Ganmodoki (Deep-Fried Seasoned Tofu):

1.  Drain the tofu in a colander or place a weight on top to remove the excess water. Julienne the carrot thinly. Slice the shiso leaves into 2 cm widths. Slice the jumbo oyster mushrooms thinly.
2.  Rinse the hijiki seaweed quickly. I used to soak the hijiki seaweed in water, but I realized that they rehydrate by being mixed with the tofu. I just rinse and mix with tofu now.
3.  Mash the tofu until smooth with a whisk. Add the ☆ ingredients and mix well. Add all the remaining ingredients and mix well.
4.  Grease your hands with vegetable oil (not listed in the ingredients) and shape the tofu mixture into 10 to 12 balls. Deep-fry them in oil heated over a medium heat.
5.  Deep-fry them slowly to cook thoroughly until golden brown. Once the balls start to float to the surface, they are ready.
6.  Serve with soy sauce and grated daikon radish These are the best while piping hot! Fluffy and soft! Healthy and tasty.
7.  Make dashi dipping sauce by combining 150 ml of boiling water and a bit less than 1 teaspoon of dashi stock granules! It is juicy, fluffy, and tasty!! Garnish with chopped green onion.
8.  There is a change to the recipe. I use 500-600 g of tofu and there is actually a big difference in the amount. Accordingly, I changed the amount of the ☆ soy sauce and ☆ salt. If you use 500 g of tofu, use less amount of them (e.g. 1/2 teaspoon of ☆ salt). Increase or reduce the amount of the seasonings according to the amount of the tofu you will use. You don't have to change the amount of the other ingredients, though.
