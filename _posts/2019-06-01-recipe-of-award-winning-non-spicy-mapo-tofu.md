3.  Capsicum, celery, mushrooms all chopped. Tofu chopped into 1cm³ blocks.
4.  Heat oil in a hot wok at high heat.
5.  If you only don't really like eating celery and capsicum and just want them for the smell, throw them in now.
6.  Add beef mince and stir until cooked.
7.  Throw in the mushrooms.
8.  Add a tablespoon of oyster sauce and soy sauce to taste. Stir well.
9.  Add 2, 3 more tablespoon off soy sauce so it is slightly saltier than you would like but not too salty.
10.  Once the shiitake mushrooms are soft enough to bite, add tofu, a bit of shiitake water and shimmer for a few minutes. If you like to eat celery and capsicum a bit raw, add them at this step.
11.  Use 1/2 cup of shiitake water to dissolve the corn starch.
12.  Slowly add the corn starch mixture into your wok and stir well until everything gets sticky.
13.  Turn off the stove.
14.  Add black pepper to your liking. Sprinkle a few drop of sesame oil. Stir well.
15.  Serve with rice.
16.  For people who like a bit of spiciness but not too much, you can add some chilly flakes at the last step.
