##### The ingredients needed to make My Okinawan Grandma's Spam & Egg Onigiri (Rice Balls):

1.  Get 700 grams or 4 servings plain, cooked rice
2.  Take 1/2 can Spam
3.  Get 2 Eggs, beaten
4.  Prepare 2 sheets nori seaweed
5.  Prepare Mayonnaise, optional

##### Steps to make My Okinawan Grandma's Spam & Egg Onigiri (Rice Balls):

1.  First, prepare the fillings. Cut the Spam into 4 slices. In Okinawa, there are may different brands of canned "pork" that are available like Tulip.
2.  Fry the slices of Spam on both sides using a generous amount of oil.
3.  After cooking the spam, cook thin "omelettes" (or more like crepes) using the remaining oil in the pan. The salt from the Spam will season the egg so you won't need to add any salt.
4.  I am using the "Homel Spam Musubi Maker" for this recipe. Place the musubi maker on top of the seaweed and add a thin layer of rice.
5.  It's a little difficult to shape the rice without the musubi maker, but you can still make it in a rice ball style: simply spread out rice across the center of the nori sheet, leaving plenty of space on each side to fold over at the end.
6.  Next, place a layer of Spam and mayonnaise on top of the rice (without mayonnaise is ok too).
7.  Lay the cooked egg on top.
8.  Add another layer of rice on top of everything and press down.
9.  Remove the musubi maker mold, if using, then wrap the edges of the nori seaweed around the layers of rice and spam.
10.  Mixing in some fresh ground pepper in the rice gives it a nice extra taste!
