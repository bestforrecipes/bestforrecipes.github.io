You can find aburaage in the refrigerated or freezer section of a Japanese grocery store.

3.  Put the ingredients marked ☆ into a pot and simmer until the juice is reduced. Turn off the heat and leave to cool.
4.  Before seasoning the abura-age, roll a rolling pin over both sides to drain. (This also makes easier to open into pockets.)
5.  Cut the abura-age in half. Put the listed ○ ingredients as well as the abura-age into a pot, simmer over medium-low heat.
6.  Cook the rice with a bit less water than usual. Pour the sushi vinegar and mix briskly. Mix in the ✿ ingredients (or plenty of sesame seeds instead).
7.  Before stuffing the rice into the aburaage, it's a good idea to prepare the exact portions of rice balls with the abura-age.
8.  Squeeze the abura-age lightly to remove the liquid and stuff the rice into each pocket.
