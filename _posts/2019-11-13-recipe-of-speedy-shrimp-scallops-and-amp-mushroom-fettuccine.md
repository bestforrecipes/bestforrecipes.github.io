##### Instructions to make Shrimp-Scallops & Mushroom Fettuccine:

1.  Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta, and boil according to package directions until al dente, tender but still slightly firm. Strain, and toss with a splash of oil.
2.  Meanwhile, arrange the shrimp and scallops in a single layer on a large pie pan or paper plate, and pat them with a paper towel until completely dry. Season with salt and pepper.
3.  Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high, sauté garlic for one minute then add mushrooms and cook for one minute
4.  Add scallops and shrimp and cook until shrimp is pink. The scallops should be cooked same time as shrimp. Cook for about 5-7 minutes
5.  Pour heavy cream directly to the shrimp scallops and mushrooms. Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Cook for about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
6.  Put pasta in a serving container then pour sauce mixture to the pasta. Don’t worry about putting too much sauce because the pasta will soak it up. Serve hot and enjoy!
