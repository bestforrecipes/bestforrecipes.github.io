##### Instructions to make Piquello glaze covered mushooms:

1.  So first off for the piquello pepper liquids you can brine it (like we do at work with saffron and black pepper corn) let is sit in there for 2 hours and use it OR another thing u can do (and I recommend this for people who wanna just make this for dinner or snack) grab 2 peppers a morter and pestle 2 limes, a pinch of saffron, and just crush the pepper, saffron, and lime juice together till a sauce forms
2.  So on to the next instruction grab the mushrooms and dice them or slice them
3.  Grab some oil and turn on fire to a low temp (110°-135°) and add garlic, thyme, sage, and add them to the oil and let sit for 1-2 hours so the oil tastes of herbs and garlic (u can save most of this oil for future use f you want) pour most oil out and leave enough just to saute (about 1/4th cup left in the pan) leave herbs in as well if u want more herby flavors to ur mushrooms
4.  Add mushrooms to oil and saute on medium high for about 5 minutes till mushrooms are soft and tender
5.  Take out garlic and herbs and strain oil from mushrooms, pat down mushrooms to lessen oil and Add the piquello sauce to taste
6.  Grate and Add Parmesan cheese as is OR fry said Parmesan cheese to add a crunchy cheese taste to your mix
7.  Enjoy!!
