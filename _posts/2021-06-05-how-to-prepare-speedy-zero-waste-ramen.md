Start by using up your old products - recycling, giving away. Being "zero waste" means that we adopt steps towards reducing personal waste and minimizing our environmental impact. Keep your hygiene routine zero waste with these simple product swaps. While the journey towards zero waste is a continuous one, these alternatives to wasteful items will make it a little easier.

##### Steps to make Zero Waste Ramen:

1.  Put veggie scraps in a large heavy pot and cover with water. Add around 2 tsp of salt, and bring to a boil. Boil them in high heat for about an hour tops.
2.  Remove the pot from the fire and strain the veggie scraps, reserving the resulting broth. It will be very bland. Don't worry, you can adjust the seasoning later.
3.  In a sauce pan mix the chicken or dashi stock with the soy sauce, the mirin, sake, sugar, rice vinegar, smashed garlic and ginger, and scallion. Stir and bring to a simmer. Cook on low heat until the mixture has reduced to about 1/2 cup of liquid. Be careful not to let the soy sauce burn. This will be the Tare, and will adjust the seasoning of the ramen.
4.  Boil two eggs, straight from the fridge, for 6 minutes. Start counting once the water starts boiling. The yolk should come up soft, or at least, perfectly yellow with no grayish rim.
5.  Add salt and pepper to both chicken thighs. In a skillet, cook the thighs skin side down first, until crispy and golden. Then flip and repeat. Set aside to rest, then cut each thigh into bite size strips.
6.  Cook the ramen noodles as instructed in the package. If you can't find any, use fresh spaghetti and replace the salt in the water with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). Around 2 tsp should do.
7.  Fold the nori sheet four times and cut it into little rectangles.
8.  Finally, assemble the ramen: place 3 tbsp of tare in the bottom of the bowl, then add the noodles, followed by 4 ladlefuls of veggie broth. Place the toppings on top (the chicken thigh, and the egg sliced in half, and 4 nori sheets). I also added a shitake mushroom, a few slices of carrot, and corn. Be creative, and add any topping you want. Some flavoured oil can also add a great finishing touch (chilli oil, sesame oil, garlic oil, etc).

And as a zero waste consumer, you're definitely being heard. While most people think of the zero waste lifestyle as having a mason jar for a trashcan, it's far less radical than it seems. Zero waste is a whole system approach that aims to eliminate rather than 'manage' waste. As well as encouraging waste diversion from landfill and incineration, it is a guiding design philosophy for.
