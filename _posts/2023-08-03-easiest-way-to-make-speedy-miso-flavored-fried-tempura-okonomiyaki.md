##### Steps to make Miso-Flavored Fried Tempura (Okonomiyaki):

1.  Add ◎ to a bowl and mix it up with an egg beater instead of sifting, add the dashi stock broth a bit at a time, and mix without kneading. Dry-fry the sakura shrimp.

3.  Heat oil in a pan, and cook over medium heat. Once the sides have hardened, flip over. Press down firmly on it with a spatula, and lightly coat the top with half of the miso.
4.  Flip it over and reduce to low heat. Press down on the batter with a spatula, and lightly cover with the remaining miso.
5.  Flip it over again, and it is done once you fry the miso. You cook it through on both sides, coat with miso, and fry it again over low heat.
6.  Garnish the fried okonomiyaki with scallions. Top with mayonnaise if you like. However, please first try a bite with just the simple taste of miso.
