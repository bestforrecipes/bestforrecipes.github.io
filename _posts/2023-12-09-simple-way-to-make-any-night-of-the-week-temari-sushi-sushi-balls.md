Temarizushi, or Temari sushi, are small and ball-shaped sushi. Temari (literally means "hand ball" in English) is a traditional Japanese embroidered ball, which people used to play within Japan. Temari sushi - 手まり寿司 - or temarizushi - are round balls of sushi rice topped decoratively with ingredients like sashimi, vegetables, seaweed sheets and fish roe.

##### Steps to make Temari sushi (sushi balls):

1.  Add sushinoko powder to cooked rice while still warm. Mix well and let it cool. (Sushinoko powder - powdered sushi flavoring bought at Mitsuwa supermarket, Japanese store in San Jose)
2.  Prepare toppings. <Grilled zucchini> Slice zucchini and grill them as desired. Olive oil is a nice touch when grilling. Gently salted and peppered. Completely cooled before making sushi balls. <Avocado + smoked salmon> Peel avocado skin and take pit out, and mash them. Add drops of lemon juice to avoid avocado getting brown and salt mashed avocado (just a hint). Cut smoked salmon in small pieces.
3.  Spread Saran Wrap (or a similar product) over palm (about twice as big as your palm). Place a topping right in the middle. Place 2 tbsp of flavored rice on top, and wrap it to a size of golf ball.
4.  FYI - Sweet sour sushi rice is usually made with cooked white rice mixed with vinegar, sugar, salt (+ konbu, a type of sea weed). I personally like using Sushinoko powder to avoid rice getting too wet. Specially, it’s easy!
