##### Steps to make Chawanmushi (Savoury Custard Soup):

1.  Make Clear Soup. Heat Dashi Stock and season with Mirin, Salt and Soy Sauce in a saucepan, and let it cool down so that it can be mixed with Eggs.
2.  Whisk Eggs in a mixing bowl and add warm Soup gradually and mix well. We are often taught to pour the egg mixture through a fine strainer to make it smooth, but I don’t do that. Just remove bubbles from the mixture.
3.  Prepare other ingredients. My method doesn’t pre-cook Chicken or Seafood, so you should use small ones or cut them into small pieces.
4.  Spinach needs preparation. Wash Spinach well and cook in boiling water until tender. Dip in cold water to stop cooking further, drain well and squeeze to remove excess water. Cut about 4cm.
5.  Place the ingredients in small bowls, cups, ramekins or whatever you use.
6.  Pour the egg mixture over the ingredients carefully. Place a young Italian parsley leaf or 'Shungiku' on top. In Japan, most commonly 'Mitsuba' leaf is placed on top, but Italian parsley tastes very similar. And it is optional.
7.  Cook them in hot steamer or microwave oven. OR you may prefer cooking them in the oven in the same way to cook Creme Brûlée.
8.  Serve 'Chawanmushi' with small spoons.
