2.  Remove the sinew from the chicken tenders and then butterfly them by slicing them almost all the way through horizontally and opening them up. A few holes in the meat are fine. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
3.  Smear the grainy mustard over one side of the chicken, put a piece of nori and cheese on top, and roll it up tightly towards the pointy ends of the chicken. Secure the rolls with wooden cocktail sticks. Make 4 rolls.
