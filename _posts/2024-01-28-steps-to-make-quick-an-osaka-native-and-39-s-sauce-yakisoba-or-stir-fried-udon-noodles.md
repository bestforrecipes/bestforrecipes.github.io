To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook an osaka-native's sauce yakisoba (or stir-fried udon noodles) using 12 ingredients and 18 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make An Osaka-native's Sauce Yakisoba (or Stir-fried Udon Noodles):

1.  Get 1 bag Chinese-style noodles or udon noodles (as thick and chewy as possible)
2.  Take 3 leaves Cabbage
3.  Make ready 1 to 2 handfuls Bean sprouts
4.  Make ready 1 Thinly sliced pork or beef
5.  Take 50 ml Dashi stock (about the concentration for miso soup)
6.  Take 40 to 60 ml Otafuku Okonomiyaki sauce orsauce
7.  Take 30 ml for udon noodles 20 ml for yakisoba … this is enough for up to two portions of noodles Sake (always use real sake, not cooking sake)
8.  Get 1 Vegetable oil
9.  Get 1 Salt and pepper … A
10.  Get 1 Tempura crumbs … B
11.  Prepare 1 Bonito flakes … B
12.  Take 1 Aonori … B

##### Steps to make An Osaka-native's Sauce Yakisoba (or Stir-fried Udon Noodles):

1.  Cut the vegetables and meat into bite-sized pieces. \*In this case, it's better to tear the cabbage by hand instead of cutting it into neat pieces.
2.  Prepare the dashi stock, it can be dash stock powder dissolved in hot water. \*Speed is essential, so prepare the sauces now too.
3.  Take the noodles out of the refrigerator and place on a plate. Sprinkle sake over it and lightly cover with plastic wrap. \*Microwave until the noodles are warm (it takes me about 1.5 minutes at 600 W).
4.  Many people warm the noodles in the bag, but a popular store told me it's better to prepare the noodles with the method in Step 3. This is essential!!
5.  Put vegetable oil in a frying pan, and heat over high. Put the meat in first and season with the A ingredients. When the meat is almost cooked through, add the vegetables. Season again with the A ingredients and stir-fry.
6.  Once the Step 5 vegetables have softened up, add the Step 3 noodles (do not add sake on the plate). Add the Step 2 dashi stock, and untangle the noodles while cooking over high heat.
7.  When the Step 6 noodles have untangled and about 90% of the dashi stock has evaporated, add the Step 2 sauce. Mix quickly and put on a serving plate.
8.  In Step 7, make sure you mix the sauce with the remaining dashi stock that hasn't been fully evaporated. This is important!!
9.  From Step 6 onwards, the process up until plating should take about 20 to 30 seconds.
10.  If you take your time here, the noodles will not only dry out, but start tasting like the instant kind.
11.  After serving onto a plate, top with the B ingredients and it's ready. Adding mayonnaise or chili pepper powder to taste is also yummy.
12.  Noodles that have dried out are never good. The sauce sticks well onto chewy noodles that have a slippery surface. This way, the noodles will taste exactly like what you'd get at a restaurant.
13.  I always use this type of sauce which is on the sweeter side. This company also makes "Yakisoba Sauce" but I like to use the "Okonomi" type.
14.  But, if you can't find it, try using the"Fake Otafuku type Okonomi Sauce".
15.  I tried various types of sauce for this recipe before posting it. The amount needed is the same at 40 to 60 ml.
16.  Always use thick noodles… Thin noodles will become soggy and mushy.
17.  To make the noodles as yummy as those cooked at restaurant griddles, make sure to keep the frying pan or electric griddle on high heat.
18.  The dashi stock added in Step 6 should evaporate if the heat is kept on high. This is an important point for keeping the noodles chewy.
