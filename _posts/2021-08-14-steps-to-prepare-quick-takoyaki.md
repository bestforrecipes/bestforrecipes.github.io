##### Steps to make Takoyaki:

1.  Cut the lettuce (if you are using), red ginger, and green onion into finest small pieces.
2.  Chop the cooked octopus into small chucks/ bite size.
3.  Add the flour, salt, and baking powder in the bowl and give a goos stir to combine all together.
4.  Add the eggs, dashi, and soy sauce in the bowl. Whisk all together until well-blended.
5.  Transfer the batter to a measuring cup or any other pitcher with a spout for easy pouring. (If you don't have any of these, use a large spoon to pour the batter to the grill pan)
6.  Heat the takoyaki pan over medium heat. Generously brush the oil on the whole takoyaki pan, for both holes and flat areas. When you see smoke coming from the pan, pour the batter to fill the holes and slightly overflow the holes.
7.  Add 1-2 octopus pieces in each hole depending on its size and sprinkle dried bonito flakes powder on top. Then sprinkle the green onion, red ginger, lettuce, and tempura scraps.
8.  Once you add all the fillings, see if the flat areas of the pan is covered with batter or not. If not, pour a little more just about to cover the whole pan, but not too much/ too thick layer.
9.  After 1-2 minutes later, or when the bottom of the balls have hardened and firmed slightly, break the connected batter between each ball with skewers/ takoyaki picks. Then turn each ball a 90 degrees, and start stuffing the edges/ extra batter as you are turing.
10.  The uncooked batter should now flow out from the inside of each takoyaki ball and creates the other side of the ball. Wait until the bottom parts are set again, turn the ball again. Repeat the turn and stuff process until all the batter is stuffed to form a ball shape. The key to create a nice round shape is to keep turning constantly.
11.  Once it's rounded and browned, transfer the takoyaki balls onto a serving plate and pour the takoyaki sauce, then mayonnaise. Finish off with sprinkling dried bonito flakes (not powder form) and dried green seaweed powder. Serve immediately, enjoy.
