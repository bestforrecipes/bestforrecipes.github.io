3.  Add 1 tablespoon of oil to a hot saucepan. Then add the chopped garlic, green chilli pepper, coriander, sugar, water, oyster sauce, fish sauce and lemon juice and mix everything together. The sauce will be ready after 2-3 minutes. If the flavour is too strong for you then feel free to adjust the concentration with some water.
4.  Boil the capellini for 1 minute longer than instructed to on the packet then rinse in cold water. Thoroughly pat the pasta dry with kitchen paper.
