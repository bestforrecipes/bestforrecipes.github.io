##### Steps to make Mike's Spitfire Shrimp & Crispy Vegetables:

1.  Here's what you'll need.
2.  Chop all vegetables and add everything to your large heated pan except for the shrimp and reserves. Fry for 5 minutes. Don't over fry. You'll want them slightly crispy. It's important to thick cut or half your extra hot peppers as so your guests can easily avoid them in their bowls if needed.
3.  Rinse shrimp, de-thaw and pull tails or shells if needed.
4.  As not to be confused, I had two different types of shrimp that needed to be used this evening. One bag pre-steamed medium sized shrimp and one extra large packet of raw shrimp. I cooked my raw shrimp first for 2 minutes in pan then added the pre-steamed to the pan just until heated. ðŸ˜š
5.  Steam covered with white wine until shrimp are fully cooked.
6.  Serve alone, over rice or over Asian noodles. Garnish dish with Cilantro or fresh Parsley. Enjoy!
