##### Steps to make Charaben Duffy Inarizushi:

1.  Stuff the cooked rice into the storebought inarizushi skins. Use a spoon to shape the rice into a ball when stuffing it inside.

9.  Place the cheese from Steps 7 and 8 onto the inarizushi from Step 6, and secure with small pieces of pasta. Stick the pasta into areas that will be covered by the face parts.
