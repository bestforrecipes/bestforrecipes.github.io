##### Steps to make Mike's Mongolian Stir-Fry:

1.  Create your basic stir fry sauce, mix all ingredients and set to the side. Double this recipe if need be.
2.  Now, decide if you'd like any one of the additional sauces listed to incorporate into your basic sauce and add.
3.  Note that if you do add more sauces, you'll need more cornstarch to thicken it. Mix 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water and set to the side. If you want your sauce thicker, slowly add to your heated wok and stir quickly.
4.  To a well heated wok or pan, and I mean smokin', with wok oil included, add your most dense foods. \[if it's hard to bite it's harder to cook\] These will be those foods that will take longer to cook. Meats, water chestnuts, broccoli, bamboo, carrots, onions, jalapeños, etc., and fry for 3 minutes or until meat or seafood is about 3/4 cooked.
5.  Add your softer ingredients like cabbage and green onions and your basic stir fry sauce and cook 2 more minutes or until sauce has thickened.
6.  Add noodles and fry as per manufactures directions. Usually about 2 minutes. Note: Noodles must be soft and ready for the wok. Pre-cooked, if you will.
7.  Serve hot and sprinkle with sesame seeds and red pepper flakes over rice.
