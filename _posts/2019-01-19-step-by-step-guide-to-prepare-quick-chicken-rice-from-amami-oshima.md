##### Instructions to make Chicken Rice from Amami-Oshima:

1.  Soak the shiitake mushrooms in water to rehydrate. Set the rice cooker timer so that it will be ready when it's time to eat.
2.  Put the chicken carcasses in a 24-cm diameter pot and pour in about 4 litres of water. Bring to a boil and skim off any scum.
3.  Cook slowly for about 1 hour over a low heat. Cut open the chicken breast to an even thickness so it cook through easier. Add the chicken to the same pot as the broth from Step 2.
4.  Slice the shiitake mushrooms and add to a pot with the 〇 seasonings, then boil the sauce down so it's nice and sweet. I think making the seasoning a little bit on the strong side is good for this, so taste and adjust.
5.  Make a thinly sliced Japanese omelet.
6.  Julienne the pickled papayas or takuan into 3-cm lengths. Finely chop the green onion, and grind the dried orange peel until powdered. Rehydrate the dried goji berries by soaking in water.
7.  After the chicken breast has cooked through, remove the skin and shred thinly. If it's too hot to handle use a fork.
8.  After cooking the chicken stock slowly for about 2 hours and it has reduced a little (so it's now richer and tastier) put through a fine sieve over a separate pot.
9.  Put the broth pot over heat and add the salt listed in the ingredients. Check the seasoning and add more salt if necessary. The saltier the stock is the better the resultant dish will be.
10.  Arrange Steps 5, 6 and 7 on a serving plate. Transfer the cooked rice to a wooden rice container (if you have one). Place a pot of the chicken stock over a portable cooker on the table.
11.  How to serve: Put a small amount of cooked rice in a individual bowl. Place the toppings of your choice on top of the rice and pour the chicken stock over. If you put too much rice it will swell up.
12.  Unfortunately, I ran out dried goji berries so I didn't use them this time.
