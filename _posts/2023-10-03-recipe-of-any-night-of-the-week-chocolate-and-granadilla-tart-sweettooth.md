3.  Melt butter over low heat. When melted, add granadilla juice and egg mixture and gently stir over low heat until it thickens.
4.  Place curd in a jar and keep in fridge until ready to use.
5.  For the Oreo cookie crust: Preheat oven to 180 celcius. Place cookies in a food processor and pulse until it turns into a fine crumb. (alternatively place cookies in a zip loc bag and bash with a rolling pin üòÇ)
6.  Melt butter in the microwave and add to cookie crumbs. Pulse until combined.
7.  Add crumb mix to greased loose bottom tart shells. Make sure to press crumbs together tightly so that it does not fall apart. Bake for 10 minutes.

12.  Brown meringue using a blowtorch or placing tarts under grill for about 3 minutes, rotating every now and then to prevent burning.
13.  Garnish with a few edible flowers. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and enjoy ü•∞‚ò∫Ô∏è

Top with a layer of biscuits. Cover and chill in the fridge overnight to set and soften the biscuits. Turn out onto a serving dish and top with extra granadilla and remaining biscuits crushed over, if you like. Beat the ideal milk until "stiffish", continue beating while adding the sugar.
