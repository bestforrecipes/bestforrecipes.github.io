9.  Prepare 1 tbsp ＊ Tiny dried shrimp

##### Instructions to make My Daughter's Favorite Basic Okonomiyaki:

1.  Chop up the cabbage into 5 mm square pieces. It's quicker to chop in a food processor, but this tends to make the cabbage too watery, so it's best to hand-chop it with a knife.
2.  Mix all the ＊ ingredients together. Mayonnaise is used to add a little oil to the batter, which makes it easier to mix. The bonito flakes and tiny dried shrimp are for adding extra umami.
3.  Add the flour to the mix gradually, in about 3 portions, mixing between each addition. Coat the chopped up cabbage with additional flour, besides the cupful used for the batter.
4.  Just before you're going to cook the okonomiyaki (this is important!) mix the batter and cabbage together. Mix up the batter from the bottom using a large spoon about 30 times, while incorporating air into it.
5.  Heat some oil in a frying pan over medium heat, and pour in about 1 and 1/2 ladles of batter in. Top with the additions of your choice, and steam-cook with a lid on both sides.
6.  Don't press down on the okonomiyaki with a spatula while you're cooking it. For the cooking oil, use some oil you previously used for tempura if you have it. It should add flavor.
7.  I used an Osaka area sauce called Kinmon sauce and Japanese Worcestershire sauce in equal amounts. "Carp sauce" from Hiroshima is delicious too.
8.  In Kansai, white rice is a must with okonomiyaki. We eat the okonomiyaki with it as a 'set meal'. I used reduced calorie mayonnaise here. You can add tempura batter crumbs (tankasu) to the batter if you'd like.
