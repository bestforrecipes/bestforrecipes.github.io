##### The ingredients needed to make Easy Sweet & Spicy Thai-Inspired Maple Glazed Salmon:

1.  Take roughly 1.75 pound salmon fillet
2.  Prepare salt & pepper to season
3.  Make ready oil for searing salmon
4.  Take large clove garlic, minced (just under a Tablespoon)
5.  Prepare shallots, thinly sliced
6.  Prepare stems cilantro, chopped (stems and leaves)
7.  Take a jalapeno, thinly sliced (or if you like hotter chilies, you can certainly use another kind)

##### Steps to make Easy Sweet & Spicy Thai-Inspired Maple Glazed Salmon:

1.  Preheat the oven to 400F and prepare an oven safe dish or baking sheet to bake the salmon in. I like to line the dish with foil for easy removal and cleanup.
2.  Season the salmon on the flesh side with salt and pepper.
3.  In a medium bowl, combine all glaze ingredients and stir to mix thoroughly.
4.  In a non-stick pan, bring the 1 Tablespoon oil up to medium high temp and sear the salmon fillet for 2 minutes per side. I sear because because I like a crust on my fish, but if you don't care for it or don't have time, just rub the flesh side with a little bit of oil and go to the next step.
5.  Transfer the salmon to your oven-safe dish, skin-side down, and pour the glaze evenly on top.
6.  Bake the salmon on the center rack for 7 to 10 minutes, depending on how done you like your fish (the full 10 minutes if you didn't sear), then turn the oven to broil and place the salmon about 5 inches under the broiler and broil for another 4 or 5 minutes to caramelize the glaze. You can serve the whole fillet family style, or portion it out with a knife or spatula, pulling the flesh away from the skin.
7.  Enjoy!
