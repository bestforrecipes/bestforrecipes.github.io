4.  Bake at 180°C for 15 minutes. Don't overbake these! Bake for a shorter time than regular baked donuts. Adjust the time depending on your oven.
5.  You can adjust the consistency of the batter with milk (or water). I've listed an average amount in the recipe, so if there are any issues please try adding more or less milk or water.
6.  Don't mix grated cheese into the batter - the donuts will become hard. It's best to sprinkle cheese into the bottom of the donut molds.
