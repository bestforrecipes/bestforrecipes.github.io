##### Steps to make Vickys Coconut Yogurt by Easiyo Yogurt Maker, Gluten, Dairy, Egg & Soy-Free:

1.  Make sure the Easiyo tubs have been sterilized before you begin. A soak in boiling water will do it. Have water ready to boil in the kettle too to fill the Easiyo flask
2.  Dissolve the agar powder in half a can of the coconut milk by putting both in a pan and heating. Do this slowly and stir often as you don't want the milk to boil but it needs to get hot to melt the powder. Take off the heat and let cool to room temperature when done then add the sugar
3.  Sprinkle the starter powder into the cooled milk and mix well
4.  Pour the rest of the milk into the large Easiyo tub and mix the milk with starter into it. Put the lid on and shake together to make sure it's mixed in well
5.  Boil the kettle and fill the Easiyo flask up to the top of the red baffle as you normally would. Put the tub of milk inside and put the lid on
6.  Leave undisturbed for a good 12 hours. Best to start this in the morning!
7.  After the 12 hours are up and you open the flask to remove the container you'll see the yogurt has split and is floating atop some coconut 'water'. This is normal. Gently put the container in the fridge and leave it overnight
8.  The yogurt will have set by now. Take the container out of the fridge and open it. The top of the yogurt may be a bit bubbly. If it's discoloured pink/grey then the batch is bad and you'll need to throw it out. This will happen if your tubs aren't sterilized so it's important you don't skip that step
9.  Scoop the thickened yogurt out into a new container to keep it thick and use the leftover liquid in a smoothie or in some baked goods
10.  Your yogurt will be good for around 3 days, well, thats how long it lasted in our fridge before we ate it all
11.  You can adjust the amount of agar powder to suit your personal preference. The directions on my agar flakes said to add 1tbsp to fully set a cup / 240mls liquid and I ground the flakes as I've found they don't dissolve easily and still used a big tbsp
12.  As for using other types of milk, the starter I used works for any kind and the amount required is the same for all. The Yogo non-dairy starter is designed for use with the Yogo yogurt maker and has instructions on the packet for use with that maker. I bought it from Ebay, it came in a pack of 4 x 5g sachets for less than £5 which makes around 3.5 litres coconut milk
13.  The Easiyo maker requires that the milk goes in cold/room temp as you warm the flask instead. I know other makers including the Yogo require the milk be heated to a certain temp but I think the basic principal of adding the sugar/starter is the same and you should in theory get the same results by following your makers instructions. Obviously I can't be sure though as I haven't tried with any other models so it's up to you to test them out!
