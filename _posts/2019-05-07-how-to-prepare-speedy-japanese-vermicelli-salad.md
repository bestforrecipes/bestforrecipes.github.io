##### Steps to make Japanese vermicelli salad ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ:

1.  Boil water in a large pan. All at once, pour the vermicelli in and stir until cooked. It's really quick and it should not be overcooked. No more than 4 minutes. See packaging instructions.
2.  Drain the water and immediately rinse it with cold water, until it's completely cold. Drain it and put it in a large bowl.
3.  Make the omelettes. They should be thin ones, to be rolled and sliced.
4.  Use a slicer for the carrots and the cucumber. I have a Benriner and it's great because it has interchangeable blades and also adjustable to make very thin slices.
5.  Separate the stripes of the kanikama, it doesn't need to be perfect. Add the carrots, the cucumber, the omelette and the kanikama to the noodles.
6.  Dilute the sugar in the vinegar. Season the salad with the vinegar, soy sauce and toasted sesame oil. Mix it well with your hands. This bit is quite messy but I haven't found a better way yet, I sometimes use gloves but I don't mind washing my hands after, it's all part of the fun! Enjoy!

Drain and blanch in cold water. Marinate vermicelli overnight in remaining oil, accent and lemon or lime juice. Next day, add all other ingredients and toss. This light and refreshing vermicelli noodle salad gets its inspiration from one of my favorite dishes of all time, Vietnamese bun salads, with fresh slivered veggies in a tangy Vietnamese rice vinegar dressing, making it a simple side dish to serve with grilled meats and chicken. The first time I made a version of this salad was when my husband and I were newlyweds.
