##### Steps to make Vegetarian Soymilk Cream Stew:

1.  \[Prep work 1\] Peel and thinly slice the onion. Peel and cut the daikon radish into 5-mm thick wedges. (Large daikon radishes should be cut into 1/6 wedges instead of quarter-rounds.)
2.  \[Prep work 2\] Slice the carrot into semi-circles or wedges. Slice the bottoms of the king oyster mushroom into 7-mm rounds, the top part of the mushrooms vertically, and the broccoli (or cauliflower) into bite-sized portions.
3.  In a deep pan, sauté the sliced onions. When tender, add the daikon radish and carrot. Keep cooking.
4.  Add the mushroom and broccoli (or cauliflower). When all the vegetables are tender, reduce to low heat. Cover with a lid and steam-cook for a while.
5.  If there is not enough moisture in the pan, pour in a small amount of water. When the daikon radish is tender, add the soy milk and bouillon powder and cook over medium heat.
6.  When it comes to a boil, lower the heat, and stir well. Add the frozen corn, salt, pepper, and maple syrup to taste.
7.  Mix the cornstarch with the same amount of water and add to the pan. Turn up the heat a little higher, then mix in large stirring motions to thicken the sauce.
8.  Once it comes to a boil, turn the heat off. Enjoy it while it's hot It goes well over steamed rice, too.
9.  Tip: Be careful not to let the soy milk over-heat or boil for too long, or it will become crumbly.
