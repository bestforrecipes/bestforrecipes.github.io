4.  Cut 1" off the woody bottoms of your asparagus. Rinse and dry asparagus.

7.  Place asparagus on a tin foil lined cookie sheet. Separate asparagus as much as you can for even baking. Squeeze your zested lemon half over your asparagus thru a strainer to collect any seeds.
8.  Place salmon on a tin foil lined cookie sheet and squeeze your other lemon half on top of it.
9.  Bake for 15 minutes at 375°. At 15 check both for doneness. Bake longer if needed based upon the thickness of both your salmon and asparagus and depending upon your individual oven. You'll want a slight crisp to your asparagus and your salmon flaky.
10.  Make your Hollandaise Sauce as per manufactures directions. Knoors will call for 1 cup whole milk and 1/4 cup butter.
