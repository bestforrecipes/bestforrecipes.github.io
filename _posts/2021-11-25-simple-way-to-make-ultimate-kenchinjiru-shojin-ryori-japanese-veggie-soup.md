##### Steps to make Kenchinjiru (Shojin Ryori) Japanese Veggie Soup ðŸŒ±:

2.  Cut the veg into similar sized pieces. This is important in zen cooking As it allows the veg to cook for the minimum amount of time and retain nutrients. Add a few squares of medium or firm tofu. You can use a soft tofu but add at the last minute or it will crumble.
3.  Simmer the veg in the Dashi until cooked. Only use just enough to cover the veg to help retain the nutrients of the vegetables. Donâ€™t overcook, they should still have some bite. Add soy sauce to taste if using.

It's good for you too!) Kenchinjiru traditionally is vegan, but I've seen many recipes that use. As Buddhism prohibits the killing of animals, true shojin-ryori eschews all meat. It uses only local and seasonal ingredients to connect the body with nature, and focuses on balance versus strong, pungent flavors. Kenchinjiru is a clear soup with a lot of vegetables.
