##### Steps to make Fridge-Clearing Shrimp Bisque:

5.  After it's cooled, take out the bay leaf and pour everything else into a blender. Blend the solids until they turn into a purée.
6.  Strain the purée and put it back in the pot. Add the milk and cook slowly over low heat. Finish with salt and pepper to taste.
