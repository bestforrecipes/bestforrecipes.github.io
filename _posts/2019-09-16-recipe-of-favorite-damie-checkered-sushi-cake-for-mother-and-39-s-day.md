3.  Wrap the part with the staple in plastic wrap.
4.  Make the base Mix 440 g of sushi rice with with the sakura denbu. Divide into two 30 g portions, one 100g portion, and two 140 g portions.
5.  Divide the remaining white uncolored rice in to one 30 g portion, two 100 g portions and one 140 g portion. Moisten the circular molds quickly with water.
6.  Place the 5 cm mold in the center of a plate, fill with 30 g of pink sushi rice and press down evenly.
7.  Add 30 g of white sushi rice on top of Step 6, and press down evenly. Add another 30 g layer of pink sushi rice and press down evenly. Remove the mold.
8.  Place the 10 cm circular mold around the Step 7 rice.
9.  Fill with 100 g of white sushi rice and press down evenly. Add 100 g of pink rice, then 100 g of white rice, pressing down evenly each time. Remove the mold.
10.  Place the 15 cm mold around the Step 9 rice.
11.  Add 140 g of pink rice, 140 g of white rice and 140 g of pink rice in that order, pressing down evenly each time. Remove the mold.
12.  When removing the mold, hold down the edges of the sushi rice with a spoon or your hands, and lift the mold up gently from the bottom little by little.
13.  Make and add the decorations. Crush the hanpen in a food processor.
14.  Coat the Step 11 rice base all over with the crumbled hanpen from Step 11.
15.  Cut the ham (or if using fish sausage, use a vegetable peeler to slice it) into strips, form a ribbon, and secure on top of the Step 14 cake with a short piece of pasta.
16.  Wrap the smoked salmon slices to form roses. Fix on top of the cake with shiso leaves, next to the Step 15 ribbon.
17.  Slice the cake Moisten your knife before slicing. The cake is quite thick, so you will need to insert your knife 4-5 times per slice. Moisten the blade each time.
18.  It's difficult and time consuming to slice the cake nicely, so I recommend slicing it first and bringing it to the table already sliced.
