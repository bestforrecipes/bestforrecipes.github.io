##### Steps to make Chicken Tender Pickled Plum Shiso Toasted Nori Seaweed Rolls:

1.  Remove the skin and sinews from the chicken tenders, open them up, and lightly stroke with the back of a knife to stretch it out and even out the thickness.
2.  Spread out kneaded pickled plum onto step 1, place the shiso leaves on top, and roll up from the side. The shiso leaves were small, so I used two for the one shown in the photo.
3.  This is what they should look like. Don't worry about the meat ripping in step 1 since they'll get wrapped up in nori seaweed. Just roll them up.
4.  Cut the nori seaweed to the size of the chicken tenders, and roll up step 3. I rolled these up in a cut half sheet of nori seaweed.
5.  Place the overlap facing downwards, and let sit for a while so that the nori seaweed closes up. The nori seaweed will shrink when toasted, so there is no need to wrap them tightly.
6.  Heat up oil in a frying pan, line up the rolls with the overlaps facing downwards, cover with a lid, and fry. Cook all the way through.
7.  Cut into bite-sized pieces and serve into plates. This is rather tasty with just the flavor of the kneaded pickled plum, but it is also tasty with grated ponzu sauce as well.
