##### Steps to make Shrimp, Egg and Pea fried rice:

1.  Get your rice going if making fresh. If using left over, leave it in the refrigerator, cold rice breaks up easier.
2.  Frozen or fresh shrimp can be used. If frozen, thaw per package directions. If fresh, peel and devein the shrimp. I used frozen, peeled and cooked here. I hate cleaning shrimp!
3.  Mix your shrimps ingredients in a bowl.
4.  Mix well, cover, let sit out for 10 minutes.
5.  Slice pepper into strips and mince your garlic
6.  Spray or oil a wok/stir-fry/skillet and set to high heat
7.  Add your shrimp to hot pan in a single layer. Leave alone for a minute.
8.  Flip each shrimp over. Leave for another minute, or until cooked through
9.  Remove to clean plate/bowl for now
10.  Re-oil pan, add pepper, fry for one minute, add garlic, fry for about 30 seconds, remove to shrimps plate/bowl
11.  Turn heat down to medium-high. Add eggs, salt and pepper. Keep eggs moving.
12.  Just before eggs are done, add frozen peas. Keep it all moving.
13.  At this point a little extra oil, or butter will give it some extra flavor and moisten the rice, if you desire. 1-2 Tbl. is good. Or leave it as is. I left this one as is, but my wife said it needed some butter.
14.  Add rice (2 cups seems about right)
15.  Stir until rice is mixed in and heated through. I like to turn the heat down to medium at this point, takes a couple extra minutes, but seems to limit scorching of bits here and there.
16.  Add your shrimp, pepper and garlic back in
17.  Stir for about 3 minutes, until it is mixed well, and all is heated through. I also put another grind of black pepper in.
18.  Serve. You can garnish with chopped green onion, cilantro or parsley (I was out, but like green onions)

It's quick to prepare and I love that it requires no chopping, easy prep!! This shrimp and rice dish always brings back memories of my childhood.

Works well with left-over cooked rice.
