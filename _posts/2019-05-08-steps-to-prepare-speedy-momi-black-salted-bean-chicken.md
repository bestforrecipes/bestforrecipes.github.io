These tasty salted black beans are commonly mixed in some of Cantonese or Chinese cuisines. Research on these dishes that uses salted black beans: Mapo Tofu, Beef with Spicy Black Bean Sauce, Beef & Peppers in Black Bean Sauce, and a whole lot more. Buy more to have enough to. But I altered it - I used six tortillas (plenty!) and doubled the beans and chicken.

##### Steps to make MOMI BLACK SALTED BEAN CHICKEN:

1.  Start with the chicken marinated with some salt, chicken stock and corn flour or any favourited marination then deep fried or it can be use just as they were
2.  Preheat cooking oil in a large pan. Start to simmer with the garlic, ginger and blended onion follows by the sliced onion for few minutes then toast in rest of the ingredients but leave the water, chicken and spring onion aside first
3.  Stir and let them simmer for few minutes then add in the chicken follows by the water. Let them boil at medium heat for about 5-10 minutes then add in the spring onion just before turning off the heat
4.  Serve while hot with some white rice for lunch or dinner

Also I used the entire onion and bell pepper (it would've just rotted in my fridge). These crowd-pleasing enchiladas are stuffed with a hearty filling of Mexican-spiced chicken, black beans, and tender bites of rice and kale (cooked together in the same pot for easy cleanup)—brought together with a bit of rich sour cream. Combine the chicken and black beans in a medium bowl; add half of the sauce mixture. I'm not sure what my family enjoys more, the beer can chicken for Sunday dinner or the black bean chicken enchiladas on Taco Tuesday. Season with sea salt, chili powder, cumin, ground chipotle, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.
