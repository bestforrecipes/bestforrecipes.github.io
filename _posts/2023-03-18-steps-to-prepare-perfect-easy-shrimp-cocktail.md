##### Instructions to make EASY SHRIMP COCKTAIL:

1.  Depending on how chunky you like your shrimp cocktail chop your veggies. My husband likes them small so you get more bite size pieces in one spoonful. Begin chopping veggies and place all into a decent size bowl. Big enough to hold juice.
2.  Once veggies are chopped clean your package of shrimp under running water. If your shrimp have tails take them off at this time. Add shrimp to chopped veggies.
3.  Squeeze your lemon on top of shrimp and veggies. Add salt and pepper.
4.  Now depending how much juice you like add your camaronazo. One bottle of 32 oz is perfect for a small bag of shrimp. In case your wondering what it looks like I've included the picture. Tomato juice or clamato work just fine.
5.  Mix together and add your Tabasco or hot sauce if you like. Add to your liking. Also at this time squeeze about maybe 2 tablespoons of ketchup. (I dont measure sorry) Chill in fridge for about three hours then serve. This is just a little side note. My mom use to make it with small chunks of Monterey cheese. I like cheese in mine but my husband doesn't like cheese in his. Just fiy if you wanted to try.

Just take me to the recipe! Place the cocktail sauce at the center of the platter, surround it by cooked shrimp. Cut the lemon into wedges or slices and tuck them in between pieces of the shrimp near the outside of the platter. Fill a large bowl halfway with ice and add water to cover; set aside. Cut one lemon into wedges and set aside.
