##### Instructions to make Gori-Chan's California Roll:

1.  Prepare the sushi rice and the fillings. Caramelized walnuts are my preference. They can be omitted if you like.
2.  Caramelized walnuts can be made by simmering about a cup of white sugar and about 2 tablespoons of water in a skillet, then adding and coating the walnuts with it once the sugar is caramelized.
3.  Make a thin egg crepe with the beaten eggs. Thaw the shrimp in a rather strongly salted water. Finely chop the green onions. Make sushi rice and let it cool.
4.  Coat the walnuts with caramelized sugar described above. Cut the cucumber into 16 sticks if you are using a large American cucumber. Peel and pit the avocado, slice in wedges and sprinkle on some vinegar to prevent it from browning.
5.  Lightly combine the cream cheese and mayonnaise, leaving in a few small lumps. These procedures will save your time.
6.  On a nori seaweed sheet, thinly spread a handful of sushi rice (about 130 g). Place the thin egg crepe and spread the cream cheese mixture on top.
7.  Arrange all the filling ingredients,adding the thinly cut cucumber sticks at the end. Press and hold the cucumber and roll up the sushi is my method.
8.  Place the rolls seam-side down. Cut the rolls into your preferred thickness. I, Gori-chan, cut the roles into 6 pieces, I like slightly large pieces.

California Roll or California Maki is a sushi roll that is made inside out. Crabstick, avocado, and cucumber are placed in the center of the nori while the flattened sushi rice with sesame seeds is on the opposite part. This is then rolled using a bamboo mat and pressed to maintain the shape. De la opinión: Muy bonito! de P.
