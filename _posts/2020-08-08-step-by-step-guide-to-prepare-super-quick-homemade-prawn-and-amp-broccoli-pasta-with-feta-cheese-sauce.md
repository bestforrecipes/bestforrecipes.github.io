To tell if your crustacean is a shrimp, there are a few small but distinguishing details to look for. Shrimp have claws on two of their legs, and the second segment of their shell overlaps the first and third shell segments. Australia and some other Commonwealth nations follow this British usage to an even greater extent, using the word "prawn" almost exclusively. The names "shrimp" and "prawn" are often used interchangeably, and understandably so. These classifications apply specifically to the most commonly farm-raised varieties, including the giant tiger prawn and the white leg shrimp.
