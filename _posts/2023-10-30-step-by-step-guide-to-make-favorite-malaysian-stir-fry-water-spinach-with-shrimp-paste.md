As for the paste u just need little thin slice coz its very salty. Just keep them in fridge as can be left for a few yrs time.
2.  Add Oil. Some prefer using lots of oil i just add them abit more if needed. High Med heat, throw in garlic for 30 secs then add shrimp paste and saute until paste form into a liquid state. (will soak up oil so add require amount if needed)
3.  Now can add in the dried shrimp (drained after soaking in water) and hot pepper and stir for a minute. (Can add in more oil if its too dry like this picture) Dont be too greedy with the paste since its gonna be salty.
4.  Throw in the veg and stir/toss/mix until slightly soften. i uses chopstick and spatula mixing.
5.  When veg shrinks up abit add a tsp of fish sauce. Mix well.
6.  Taste it. if bland add a little more fish sauce or salt.
