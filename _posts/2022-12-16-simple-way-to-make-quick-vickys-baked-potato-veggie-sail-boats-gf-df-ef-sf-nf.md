##### Instructions to make Vickys Baked Potato Veggie Sail Boats, GF DF EF SF NF:

1.  Preheat the oven to gas 5 / 190C / 375F
2.  Prick the potatoes all over with a fork, rub with oil, sprinkle with a bit of salt then bake for 1 hour until the skin is crispy and the insides are soft. Meanwhile, boil some salted water on the stove and cook the chopped veggies until done. A bag of frozen mixed veg is perfect for this
3.  Remove the potatoes and let them cool until you can handle them. Cut each potato in half and scoop out the insides leaving a rim so they hold their shape and don't fall to pieces. (If the kids don't like the skins remove them)

Stir in all the veggies and spoon the mixture back into each potato half, heaping well and sprinkle with cheese if desired. You can also mix the cheese in with the potato as you mash it. - Pop them back into the oven and reheat for about 10 minutes or until the cheese is fully melted
5.  Thread a bread triangle onto a short skewer and place through the potato and filling to look like a mast
6.  These are great for lunch and are fun for birthday parties too, a healthy option!
