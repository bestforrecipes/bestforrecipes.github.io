3.  Put the olive oil, garlic, anchovies, olives, capers and tuna in a frying pan, and sauté over medium heat.

5.  Start cooking the pasta.
6.  Put the pan back on the heat and evaporate the alcohol in the wine. Add the tomato sauce, season with salt and pepper and taste. If it tastes a bit salty, it is just right.
