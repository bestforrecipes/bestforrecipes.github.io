##### The ingredients needed to make Shrimp, arugula and goat cheese rotini:

6.  Get fresh rosemary
7.  Take easy-peel shrimp, 31/40 size
8.  Make ready goat cheese
9.  Prepare (packed) arugula
10.  Take cherry tomatoes, halved

Place the arugula and sliced tomato on top of the goat cheese, and serve. In a medium saucepan, bring the stock to a simmer. Add the tomatoes to the frying pan and, holding the pan handle, roll the tomatoes around by jerking the pan. Directions: Put the dried cranberries in a small bowl and pour the boiling water over them.

##### Instructions to make Shrimp, arugula and goat cheese rotini:

1.  Add the pasta to a pot of boiling salted water.
2.  Add a pinch of course salt to the garlic and crush it until it's paste, using the flat of your knife against a cutting board. Put the garlic in a large mixing bowl along with the olive oil and a pinch of salt and several grinds of freshly cracked black pepper. Add the lemon juice and rind.
3.  Add a large splash of extra virgin olive oil to a medium pan. Press down with your palm on the unpeeled garlic cloves to crush them slightly, then add them to the pan along with the rosemary sprig. Let the oil infuse for 3 or 4 minutes, then fish out and discard the garlic and rosemary.
4.  Add the shrimp to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook the shrimp until they just begin to turn evenly pink. This will only take a few minutes. Remove the shrimp and peel off their shells. Keep the oil from the pan.
5.  Drain the rotini once it's cooked and add it to the mixing bowl of oil and garlic. Break up the goat cheese and add it also. Toss while the pasta is hot so the cheese can melt. Add the shrimp and its cooking oil as well as the arugula and tomatoes. Toss again, until the arugula wilts. Season with extra salt and pepper to taste.

Put the arugula in a large serving bowl. Scatter the pecans and goat cheese over the top. Drizzle with the cranberry vinaigrette and serve immediately. Make the Spicy Shrimp: Place the shrimp in a large zip-top plastic bag. In a small bowl, stir the paprika with the garlic powder and cayenne to combine.
