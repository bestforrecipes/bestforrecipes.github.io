Quick and dirty instructions for cooking perfectly juicy and tender chicken breasts for salads and sandwiches. For years, when I wanted a chicken salad or sandwich and tried to cook a whole chicken breast on the stove, I FAILED every time. These chicken sandwiches are so clucking good. When you have a craving for a chicken sandwich, look no further.

##### Instructions to make Mozzy Chicken Baked Sandwiches:

1.  Heat olive oil in electric fry pan browning chicken lightly on each side after dipping breasts into egg and lightly adding salt and pepper Remove from pan, place on paper towel. Remove two or three breast slices and freeze the remainder. NOTE: I add the unused egg and pull out the light scramble without mixing it much and set it aside for plating.
2.  Sauce. Add together all the sauce ingredients and allow to simmer adding wine then milk, alternating for flavor. Add seasoning, especially salt if necessary by the small pinch.
3.  Hand fluff the pulled chicken with the spices and toss the chicken into the sauce once the sauce is creamy and savory. Add a little more wine, olive oil, and milk to obtain a creamy tasty consistency. Salt only if necessary, under salt before ruining this dish with too much salt–never over salt, though it is okay to over-pepper. Saute to meld flavors with meat.
4.  In the electric skillet push all the chicken and sauce to one side, lay down one slice of oiled bread and scoop the chicken sauce all over the bread slice. Add the other slice of oiled bread. Fry lightly in olive oil, though it is yummy to obtain a bit of a darkness to the fry a darker brown. Add all the cheese to the chicken and allow to begin to melt.
5.  The sandwiches will probably be falling into pieces, but that is the plan. Lift the sandwiches, in pieces if necessary, out onto a small cooking sheet or pan for the oven, and continue to place pieces on the sheet until there is nothing left in the fry pan. Preheat the convection oven to turbo or 400 degrees F. Just before placing the sandwiches into the oven, open the sandwiches and place the remaining saved off egg scramble.
6.  Bake sandwiches until browned and toasty, no more moisture on bread, though lots of yummy sauciness inside sandwiches.
7.  Salad. Slice grilled or fried peach slices to make bite size pieces. Do the same to the cucumber, which should be icy cold. Splash with lime juice and hand toss. Toss lightly the warm and the cold, add the dry spices and the dates or figs. Into a small bowl add the olive oil, wine, balsamic vinegar, and remaining spices with a splash of lime. Crunch up a handful of corn chips and layer corn chips with salad into a ramekin and serve cold.
8.  Using a cutter or glass, place cutter over baked sandwich and lift with a spatula. Place on a plate in a pair or a trio with the ramekin also placed on the plate. Sprinkle the sandwich cutouts lightly with caviar. Serve with red wine and ice cold water with lime juice sprinkled into the water for flavor and freshness.
