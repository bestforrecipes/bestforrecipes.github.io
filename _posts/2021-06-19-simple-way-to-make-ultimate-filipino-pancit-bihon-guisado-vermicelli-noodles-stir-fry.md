##### Steps to make Filipino Pancit Bihon Guisado - Vermicelli Noodles Stir Fry:

1.  Salt & pepper the chicken, liver and pork tips. Par boil in a pot with the bullion cube then cut into strips or chop if you prefer bone-in and set aside. Wash and dip the vermicelli in clean water then leave to soak in the liquid used to boil the meat.
2.  In a deep pan or wok, sauté the garlic and onions. Drop in the bell pepper if you prefer it softer, if not, add later.
3.  Add chicken, pork, liver, shrimps, woodear mushrooms and sauté with a dash of soy sauce. The optional proteins are up to you. It can just be the basic chicken. It can also be leftover roast chicken or meat. That's why the Pancit is so versatile. :) Sauté whatever you have at this point with the garlic and onions, except the already fried fishballs (add that when ready to serve).
4.  Sauté 3 mins. Drop in the chilies now if you prefer a little heat. Mix in.
5.  The key note : the more protein and veggies, the tastier, so choose at least 2-3 to add in the wok from the optional ingredients.
6.  Add green beans, if any, carrots and the stalky parts of the cabbage. Sauté 3 mins.
7.  Drop in the remaining cabbage, pechay, and celery. Mix in. Season with salt and pepper.
8.  In a minute add the drained noodles into the wok. Stir/mix in the veggie-meat mix. Note: the pancit should not be dripping with liquid. The finished product should not be saucy. So drain well.
9.  Distribute the oyster sauce and soy sauce. Mix in thoroughly. You'll see the noodles change in color. Add in your fish balls, if any
10.  Taste and add more oyster or soy sauce according to your preferred taste. Keep sautéing until desired softness (or al denté) of the noodles is achieved.
11.  At this point all the veggies, proteins, and noodles should be cooked so remove from heat and transfer to your serving bowl.
12.  Serve with green onions, fried garlic and calamansi on the side.
13.  How to eat? Get a serving, sprinkle with green onions and garlic on top. Then get a calamansi or lime slice (or two) and squeeze over the noodles, around the plate. Enjoy! :)
