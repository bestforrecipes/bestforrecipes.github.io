4.  While salmon cooks, create mayo sauce by adding 1/2 cup mayo, 1 tbsp lemon juice and 1 tbsp garlic powder in a bowl and stir.

6.  When cooking is near done (salmon should be more transparent and a lighter pink in color; veggies should be soft) turn down the heat and mix in mayo sauce. I like to go ahead and let the salmon flake to pieces while mixing everything together. Grind some extra pepper on top, if you like pepper as much as I do :)
