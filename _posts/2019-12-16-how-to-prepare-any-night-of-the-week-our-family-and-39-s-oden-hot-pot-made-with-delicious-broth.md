##### Instructions to make Our Family's Oden Hot Pot Made With Delicious Broth:

1.  Re-hydrate the kombu in plenty of water. If you're in a hurry, use hot water.

3.  Peel the taro root and rub with salt to remove the sliminess. Put in a saucepan with water and heat. Bring to a boil, then simmer until tender.
4.  Boil the eggs and peel the shells.
5.  Rub the konnyaku with salt and make incisions on the surface. Rinse the shirataki noodles in boiling water.

12.  Check and adjust the seasoning if needed with light soy sauce or salt. Turn off the heat and leave to cool to let the ingredients absorb the flavour.
13.  I added squid to the hot pot I made in 2010. It gave a great flavour to the soup with the beef tendons.
