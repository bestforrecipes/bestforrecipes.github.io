##### Instructions to make Mango Cheesecake:

1.  Start with the bottom layer of the mango cheesecake. - Take 20 digestive biscuits on a paper and crush with a rolling pin or blend in a food processor till coarse crumbs. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Melt the butter and add to the crumbs. Mix well. Grease a spring form pan and press down the prepared biscuit mixture and spread well. Press with the bottom a flat bowl to smoothen. Chill it for 30 minutes while the next layer is prepared.
2.  For the Mango Cream Cheese Layer - Tear the Agar Agar strips and soak in 1/2 cup water and set aside. - Boil the half litre milk and add a spoon of vinegar. Once the whey separates strain. Mix the Greek yoghurt and fresh cheese, whisk till smooth. To this add the fresh cream and the vanilla extract and mix very well.
3.  Take the soaked Agar Agar and boil it until it is completely dissolved. Puree the diced mangoes along with the sugar and transfer to a bowl. - Add about 1 1/2 cups of mango puree to the cream cheese mixture and mix well. Add the Agar Agar liquid to the prepared mango cream cheese mixture and whisk well immediately. - Quickly pour this mango cream cheese layer over the chilled biscuit crust and smoothen it nicely. - Set in fridge for 30 minutes and prepare the top jelly layer.
4.  Mango glaze for the mango cheesecake. - Boil the Agar Agar liquid till smooth and add the mango puree and cook for a couple of minutes. Pour this mango jelly glaze over the set mango cream cheese layer carefully. Chill the prepared cheesecake for at least 4 hours but I like it overnight. I greased disposable and glass bowls with butter instead of the springform pan and when I tried to extract it was messy. You can set and serve in individual bowls
