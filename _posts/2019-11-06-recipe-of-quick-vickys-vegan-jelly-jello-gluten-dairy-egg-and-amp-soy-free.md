##### The ingredients needed to make Vickys Vegan Jelly/Jello, Gluten, Dairy, Egg & Soy-Free:

Looking for a gluten-free pancakes recipe that is also free from dairy and eggs?

##### Steps to make Vickys Vegan Jelly/Jello, Gluten, Dairy, Egg & Soy-Free:

1.  Boil the water and add the agar stirring until dissolved. Different brands have different diluting instructions but the basic rule is 1tsp powder/ 1 tbsp flakes to 8 fl oz / 240 mls liquid. If using leaf gelatine, soak the sheets in cold water and then discard the water, adding straight to the boiling juice
2.  Pour the agar mix into the fruit juice and stir well until thickening
3.  Layer the fruit in the botton of your mould or moulds, I prefer to use individual ones for the children, then pour the liquid on top
4.  Let cool, then refrigerate to set. Citrus fruits will take longer to set so I add an extra quarter teaspoon of powder if I'm using say, orange
5.  To free from the mould set it in hot water for a few seconds.
6.  The texture using agar-agar is not exactly the same as regular gelatine jelly but still highly enjoyable
