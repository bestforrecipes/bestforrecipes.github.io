##### Steps to make Thai basil pork (pad krapow moo):

1.  Cut the chillis in half and transfer along with the garlic to a pestle and mortar. Gently crush garlic and chilies together, until you get a coarse paste. Tip: If you don't have a mortar, as an alternative use a blender instead.
2.  Wash the runner beans in a sieve, drain the excess water and cut of the tops and bottoms. Then place back into the sieve. Get a small amount of runner beans on a chopping board. Cut the runner beans into roughly half an inch, small circular pieces.
3.  Place onto a plate and repeat until all runner beans have been cut and set aside.
4.  Grate the palm sugar block over a small bowl (or use white sugar) and set aside.
5.  In a wok, add and heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Now add the chilli and garlic paste and fry until fragrant (the aroma and spiciness is realstes) stirring occasionally to not burn the garlic.
6.  Once aromas fills the kitchen add the mince meat to the wok. Break up the mince meat with a spatula into small pieces. Stir the mixture frequently, until the mince is almost cooked.
7.  Add the runner beans to the mixture and stir occasionally until the soft and cooked. Turn the heat to medium.
8.  Add the oyster sauce, soya sauce and fish sauce to wok. Thoroughly mix together. Add palm sugar (white sugar), water and stir well. Once combined taste it and adjust (if needed add more soy, oyster sauce fish sauce or sugar). It should have a sweet, salty and spicy flavour all at the same time.
9.  Turn the heat to low and let the runner beans cook to desired softness. Then add the basil leaves and let it cook for a minute, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat, cover with a lid and set aside.
10.  Now time to make the fried egg. In a pan on medium heat, add a tiny amount of oil and let it heat up. Oil is ready when it becomes shimmery and very loose. Crack the egg into a small bowl and gently place in the pan.
11.  Let the egg cook for a few minutes. Do not move the egg, the whites will slowly begin to set. In the meantime, in a small bowl scoop some rice. Mould the rice and transfer to a serving bowl and set aside. Add some of the stir fried beef with holy basil onto the serving bowl. Go back to check the eggs.
12.  When the whites are set and the yolk is cooked to your preference (I like my yolk runny). Remove from the pan immediately and place over the rice. Tip: if you prefer your yolk a bit more cooked, once egg is crispy on the edges flip it over gently. Cook the other side for a minute and turn off heat.
13.  Its ready to serve. Eat immediately while hot. Serve with one or two lime wedges (squeeze lime over the dish before eating).

Quickly turn it over a few times to mix the leaves with the meat and then remove from the heat and serve hot with rice. The key ingredient here is Thai holy basil (krapow) which has a wonderful vibrant, sweet and flavoursome aroma. You could use a little combination of mint and basil if you can't get your hands on itm but. An easy and fast recipe for vegetarian Thai basil tofu stir fry aka Tofu Pad Krapow.
