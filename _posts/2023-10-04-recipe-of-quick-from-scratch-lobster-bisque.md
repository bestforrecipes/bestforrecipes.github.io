##### Steps to make From Scratch Lobster Bisque:

1.  Boil the lobsters in an 8 quart stock pot until they are red and pretty well cooked, between 10 and 15 minutes or so.
2.  Reserve 10 cups of the boiling water, as this will be the base of the bisque.
3.  Break down the lobster into meat and shells/carcasses, placing the shells back into the reserved water and setting aside the meat.
4.  Boil the shells/carcasses about ten minutes, and then discard the shells/carcasses while saving the water.
5.  Set the water aside, place the oil, butter, onion, carrot, celery, salt, bay, garlic, and cayenne into a large frying pan, and sweat it all out a bit. Yes, it is a lot of butter, but bisque is buttery.
6.  Deglaze the veggie mix with wine, let the alcohol burn off a few moments, and then transfer the frying pan contents into a blender. Puree.
7.  Add the veggie sludge to the lobster water, mix well, and simmer on medium low.
8.  Add the tomato paste, and mix really well to get the blobs out.
9.  Add the heavy cream. Yes, it is a lot of cream, but bisque is creamy. Mix.
10.  Take a cup of the broth, let it cool a few minutes, and mix the cornstarch into it.
11.  Add the cornstarch mixture back to the broth, mix it in, and then simmer and stir to thicken, for about 20 minutes or so.
12.  Mince the lobster meat, and then add it to the broth. Don't add it sooner, else you may create rubbery meat bits.
13.  Serve immediately, though it might still be a bit thin. It will thicken by the next day, though. If I had you add more cornstarch, it would be all congealed by the next day.
