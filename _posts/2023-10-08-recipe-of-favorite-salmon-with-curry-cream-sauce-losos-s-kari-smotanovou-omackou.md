4.  Add some butter and seasoned salmon on the pan and cook it from both sides. In the end spread lemon juice over cooked salmon equally. (Pridáme trochu masla a nakoreneného lososa na panvicu a upečieme z oboch strán. Na záver pokvapkáme citrónovou šťavou.)
5.  Pour out water from potatoes and add the butter, milk and smash potatoes until you got smooth mixture. Add salt if needed. (Vylejeme vodu zo zemiakov a pridáme maslo, mlieko a rozmačkáme zemiaky pokiaľ nedostaneme jemnú zmes. Prisolíme ak treba.)
6.  In a small pan cook chopped onion with butter until golden brown. Add whipped cream, honey, soy sauce, mustard and spices and cook it with constant stirring until sauce thickens.

Pridáme šľahačkovú smotanu, med, sójovú omáčku, horčicu a korenie a varíme za stáleho miešania kým nám omáčka nezhustne. Na záver pridáme šťavu z polovice citróna.)
