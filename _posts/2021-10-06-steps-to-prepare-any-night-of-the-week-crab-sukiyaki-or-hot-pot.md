##### Instructions to make Crab Sukiyaki (or Hot Pot):

3.  Prepare the crab. Place the bottom of the knife blade on the joints and you should be able to cut the crab legs easily. Kitchen scissors also work well.
4.  Make slits on the shells of crab legs with a knife. Move the blade so as to peel off the shell (if you think it is difficult, cut the leg joints lengthwise).

6.  If you add the crab shells and trimmings to the dashi, it'll enhance the flavor. Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables.
7.  Put all the ingredients except the crab and mizuna leaves in a clay pot. Pour in the soup stock. Add the crab after the ingredients are cooked through about 80%.
8.  Bring back to a boil, add the mizuna and cook in residual heat. Do not overcook the crab. Serve with plenty of soup!
