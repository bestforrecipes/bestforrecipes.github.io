To get started with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook spam musubi using 6 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Spam Musubi:

1.  Take 12 ounces Spam
2.  Get 1/4 cup oyster sauce
3.  Get 1/4 cup soy sauce
4.  Take 1/4 cup soy sauce
5.  Take Nori roasted seaweed used for sushi, cut into halves or thirds (I cut it into thirds to make it go further)
6.  Make ready 6 cups cooked sushi rice

##### Steps to make Spam Musubi:

1.  Slice the SPAM into about 8-10 slices (depending on how thick you like it) and put in a Ziplock bag.
2.  Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce and sugar until sugar is dissolved and add to the bag with the SPAM. Marinate for about 15 minutes.
3.  Drain off marinade and fry SPAM on each side over medium heat until slightly crispy or until desired doneness. Some people like to glaze the SPAM with the marinade/sauce AFTER frying, either way tastes great!
4.  Place a strip of nori on a cutting board or clean surface (shiny side down). Place your Musubi mold across the middle of the nori (so if you folded up the sides of the nori, it would wrap around the middle of the can)I made a mold from the spam can be careful when cutting can!
5.  Add Sushi Rice to the mold, pressing down firmly so there is about 1-1 1/2 inches of rice (if the rice starts to stick to the mold too much, dip it in water.Next, remove the mold from the rice. Now you will have a nice little block of rice right on the nori.Add some of the cooked spam to the top. Wrap up one side of the nori and stick it to the top of the SPAM, then wrap up the other side.Use a little water on your finger to seal if needed. Serve warm.
6.  Some like it dipped in soy sauce, some like it with ketchup, and some like it as is. You will just have to try it all the different ways and decide for yourself which way you like it best.
