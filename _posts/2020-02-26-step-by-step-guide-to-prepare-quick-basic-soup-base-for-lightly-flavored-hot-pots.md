##### Instructions to make Basic Soup Base for Lightly-Flavored Hot Pots:

1.  If possible, put the kombu in water and let it sit overnight. If you don't have the time, just let it cook and take out the kombu right before it starts to boil.
2.  Once you remove the kombu, let the pot boil, add a (big!) handful of bonito flakes, and let it simmer for 4 to 5 minutes.
3.  When that's done, turn off the heat and leave for 1 to 2 minutes. Once the flakes sink to the bottom, remove with a skimmer or a perforated ladle while squeezing them out.
