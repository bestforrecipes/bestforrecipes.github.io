##### Instructions to make Vietnamese Spring Rolls:

1.  Working with 1 rice wrapper at a time, dip it in warm water for only 1 second (just until soft enough). Lay wrapper on a flat work surface.
2.  To assemble each roll, lay a lettuce leaf horizontally on the bottom half of the moistened rice wrapper. At the base of the lettuce, place several strands of noodles, a little each of the carrot and cucumber, 2 slices each of avocado and eggs, several leaves of mint and cilantro. Be careful not to overstuff the rolls, otherwise the wrapper will get torn.
3.  Fold in the sides of the rice paper and lift the bottom edge of the rice paper and carefully place over the noodles and other ingredients, then put 3 or 4 shrimp on top then roll to form a tight cylinder.
4.  Place the prepared rolls, seam side down, on a platter and cover with a damp kitchen towel. The rolls can be held at room temperature for several hours before serving.
5.  To make the peanut hoisin sauce : heat the oil, saute the garlic until golden. Add the remaining ingredients. Cook until it boils and thickened. Adjust the taste.
6.  To make the fish sauce : mix all the ingredients. Stir until the sugar dissolved. Taste it. Add sugar and water as needed to adjust the taste because every different fish sauce brand has different saltiness.
7.  Serve the rolls with either one of the sauces or both. I prefer to have both sauce for my rolls because the combination of both flavor is just amazing.
