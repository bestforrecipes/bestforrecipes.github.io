##### Steps to make Garlic Ginger Beef and Broccolini:

1.  Prepare your marinade by getting your wet ingredients into a bowl. Add the dry ingredients and whisk vigorously. Dump into a large freezer bag along with beef. Marinade at least 2 hours. Turn the bag over half way through. I don’t know if there is science behind it, but it makes me feel better.
2.  Remove beef from fridge and get it on the skewers. Put a little oil in a pan and get it hot. You can cook down the remaining marinade as a sauce. I don’t recommend going heavy on it though. Just a drizzle at the end.
3.  Cook the beef on a Med-High setting for about 3 minutes on one side and 2 minutes on the other. Use your judgement.
4.  Boil the broccolini for about 3 minutes to get the bitterness out. Immediately submerge in cold water.
5.  Get the chilli oil hot with the garlic and ginger. Add in the broccolini. Heat it with the fish sauce and seasonings. Pan fry until fork tender, but leave a little crunch.
6.  Drizzle a little of the reduced marinade on the beef. Serve with white rice.

Add water and broccoli, stir quickly. Add marinated beef into wok, combine with garlic and ginger. Spread beef evenly bottom of work, and cook until edge is darken and crispy, about a Stir frequently so sauce will not burn. We don't need to cook broccolini, just. In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce, cornstarch, sherry, brown sugar, ginger and garlic.
