##### Instructions to make Vongole Bianco with Oysters and Olive Oil:

1.  Clean the oysters well. Take 1 or 2 small ones and chop roughly.
2.  Look at Takuno-san's easy way to clean oysters. - - [https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/148389-how-to-rinse-oysters-to-a-glossy-finish](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/148389-how-to-rinse-oysters-to-a-glossy-finish)
3.  Put 3 L of water into a large pot and bring to the boil. Just before it comes to the boil add 2 tablespoons of salt (1% of salt to the water).
4.  The sodium content in the water from the pot in Step 3 is an important factor in deciding the resultant taste so measure the amount of salt precisely. After bringing the pot to the boil, keep it over a very low heat.
5.  Put A ingredients into a cold frying pan. Place the pan over a low heat. Cook slowly to infuse the garlic flavour into the oil.
6.  When it starts to bubble around and the garlic becomes fragrant, add the red chili before the garlic is golden brown.
7.  Add the chopped oyster from Step 1.
8.  When the Step 7 garlic is golden brown add the butter. Turn the heat to medium and add the rest of the oysters.
9.  Add salt and pepper. Cover with a lid and steam the oysters, keeping the heat constant.
10.  Meanwhile put the pasta in and drain 30 seconds to 1 minute earlier than the package instruction says until al dente. Cook over a low heat.
11.  If you boil the pasta cooking liquid vigorously the liquid will evaporate fast and the pasta will be salty.
12.  \[Note:\] Do not boil the water vigorously before or after you put the pasta in.
13.  Before the oysters are cooked through, add B ingredients and stir well. Measure the pasta cooking liquid with a measuring spoon and pour in.
14.  After the oysters from Step 9 are cooked through turn off the heat. When you see the oysters are plump and the edges are shrunk the oysters are done.
15.  Just before the pasta is cooked add Step 13 and Step 14. Cook over a medium heat. Move the frying pan around for 15 seconds.
16.  \[Note:\] At Step 15 when the sauce starts to thicken turn off the heat. The sauce is emulsified.
17.  To make the pasta dish with olive oil-based sauce the emulsion of the sauce is very important. You cook a small amount of pasta at home so you don't get enough starch in the pasta cooking liquid to emulsify the sauce.
18.  By adding the flour it helps the sauce to emulsify. You will have a restaurant-quality sauce in this way.
19.  I usually use a mixture of pasta cooking liquid and flour but here I used pasta cooking liquid, water and salt to moderate the salt taste.
20.  The ratio of water and pasta cooking liquid amount differs according to the amount of white wine and your taste. Do not reduce the sauce too much otherwise the sauce will be very salty.
21.  After the pasta boils, drain the pasta and add it to the oysters from Step 15 (over low-medium heat).
22.  Sprinkle with coarsely ground pepper. Add more salt if necessary.
23.  Sprinkle with Italian parsley. I like green onion with oysters so here I used green onion to garnish.
24.  This is a simple dish but it is tasty with plenty of garlic and fragrant white wine. You will enjoy the tasty oysters
25.  It is easy but really tasty. Serve with chilled white wine.
26.  This is Pasta in Clam Soup. Enjoy the tasty clam soup.
27.  This is an authentic Bongole Bianco (Recipe: ID 1387665).

But go for fresh if you can! Heat the olive oil in a pan over a medium heat. Vongole means clams in Italian, so it literally means spaghetti with clams. The pasta of choice is spaghetti and the fresh clams are cooked with olive Next, heat up a skillet with olive oil and butter, saute the clams and add white wine and pasta water. Add the spaghetti into the clam sauce, stir to.
