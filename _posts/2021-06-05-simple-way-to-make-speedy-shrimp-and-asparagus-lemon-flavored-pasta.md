5.  When there are 3 minutes remaining to the pasta from Step 1, add 3 tablespoons of oil to a pan and heat. Add the garlic, red pepper, and onion, and saute.
6.  Add the shrimp to the pan. When they turn a little pink, add the sherry and mix. Add the blanched asparagus and season with a little salt.
7.  Transfer the cooked pasta out of the pot with tongs and into the pan without draining. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, and add plenty of lemon juice.
