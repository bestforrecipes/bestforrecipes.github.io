##### Instructions to make Sheree's Homemade Sushi:

3.  Add 2 1/4 cup water to cooker and place pot in cooker and set to cook. Once its finished let sit undisturbed for 10 minutes. If longer leave on warm.
4.  When ready put hot rice in glass or wooden bowl. Pour RICE VINEGAR/ SUGAR mixture over rice.
5.  Using wooden spoon or rice paddle gently stir from the bottom. Once its all been gently folded… Use the edge of spoon to 'slice' through and break up rice
6.  Fold rice again and again break up clumps with a slicing motion.
7.  I put plastic wrap on top of the rice… Not over the bowl but touching the rice… This will keep it moist.
8.  I prepare all my ingredients that I want to use. These were made with deli crab salad with sirrachi added…. Cream cheese…. Avocado…
9.  I put plastic wrap on my sushi mat.. I take a piece of nori and press rice into it … Leaving 1" of space around edges. Turn nori upside down.. So that rice is on the bottom. I put plastic wrap and mat ontop and flipped it…
10.  I put a thin row of cream cheese…. A thin row of Crab meat salad…. And avocado…
11.  I picked up edge of mat and plastic wrap and start rolling. Tuck the end under the filling and squeeze lightly.. Keep rolling and lightly squeezing. Until the entire sheet of nori is finished.
12.  Wrap the roll in the plastic wrap firmly. Place mat over the top and squeeze roll firmly to hold it together.
