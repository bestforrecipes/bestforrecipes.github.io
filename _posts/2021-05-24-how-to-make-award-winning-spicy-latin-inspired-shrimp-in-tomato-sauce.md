##### The ingredients needed to make Spicy Latin-Inspired Shrimp in Tomato Sauce:

2.  Prepare 1 Tablespoon butter

5.  Take 4 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 Tablespoons)
6.  Prepare 1/4 cup chopped cilantro + more for garnish
7.  Make ready 1 packet Goya Sazón (Any kind - culantro, achiote, azafrán, etc. - will work fine in this dish.)
8.  Take 1/4-1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
9.  Make ready 1 cup tomato sauce
10.  Get 1/4 cup unsalted chicken stock or white wine
11.  Take 1-2 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice
12.  Take 1/4 teaspoon salt to start

##### Steps to make Spicy Latin-Inspired Shrimp in Tomato Sauce:

1.  In a large pan (at least 12") preheat the oil and butter on medium heat until all the butter is melted.
