4.  Add the mushroom and broccoli (or cauliflower). When all the vegetables are tender, reduce to low heat. Cover with a lid and steam-cook for a while.
5.  If there is not enough moisture in the pan, pour in a small amount of water. When the daikon radish is tender, add the soy milk and bouillon powder and cook over medium heat.
6.  When it comes to a boil, lower the heat, and stir well. Add the frozen corn, salt, pepper, and maple syrup to taste.
7.  Mix the cornstarch with the same amount of water and add to the pan. Turn up the heat a little higher, then mix in large stirring motions to thicken the sauce.
