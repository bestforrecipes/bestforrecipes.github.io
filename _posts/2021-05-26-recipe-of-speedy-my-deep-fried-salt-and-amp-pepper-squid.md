It's not always an easy ingredient to find though, and it's quite a. This unusual technique for deep-frying creates a dish of savoury salt cod, eggs and cauliflower balanced by sweet red pepper sauce. Drain the salt cod, pat dry and set aside. Of course, deep fried, salt covered potato chips aren't a very healthy side dish.
