##### Instructions to make 2-way No Bake Chocolate Mousse Cake:

1.  Melt the cooking chocolate and slowly fold in the cream and sugar. For the biscuit crumb base, blend the biscuits and add butter. Transfer at the base of the pan, press gently and chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
2.  Add roughly broken strands of Agar Agar to a pan of one fourth cup of water for 5 minutes until completely dissolved. Keep stirring it at regular intervals. Now finally stir this in the Chocolate mix. Pour this Chocolate cream mix on the biscuit base. Allow it to set overnight in the fridge. Gelatin can also be used if Agar Agar is not available. In India, it's available in powder form too at Amazon. It's a pure Vegetarian one. So I prefer using it always.
3.  Now for the Cake based Mousse cake, follow the same method and pour the chocolate cream mix over the chocolate flavoured sponge cake and set it overnight in the refrigerator.
