Pickled Matsumae is one of the most favored of current trending foods on earth. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It is simple, it’s fast, it tastes yummy. Pickled Matsumae is something that I have loved my entire life. They’re fine and they look fantastic.

To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have pickled matsumae using 8 ingredients and 12 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Pickled Matsumae:

1.  Prepare 2 pieces Dried squid
2.  Get 30 cm Kombu
3.  Take 1 small Carrot
4.  Make ready 6 small pieces Herring roe
5.  Prepare 133 ml ●Sake
6.  Prepare 133 ml ●Mirin
7.  Get 133 ml ●Soy sauce
8.  Take 1 Yuzu peel

##### Instructions to make Pickled Matsumae:

1.  Use three times the amount of water for every 100 g of herring row with a small teaspoon of salt (not listed), and let soak for 2 hours changing the water 5-6 times. Lastly, peel the membrane from the roe.
2.  Lightly pat dry both sides of the dried squid with a rag that has been thoroughly rung out. (Cheap paper towels will leave behind lint, so they're no good).
3.  Cut off the legs, and cut off the hard parts from the trunk (you won't use them).
4.  Cut it up as finely as you possibly can with a pair of scissors as it'll expand later when cooking. If the squid is too tough, sprinkle with sake or soak completely to soften. Keep the leftover sake for later as we'll use it later.
5.  Lightly wipe the konbu seaweed with a rag, sprinkle with sake to soften, and julienne. If the konbu is too soft, it will be difficult to cut, so be careful.
6.  Finely chop the carrots as well.
7.  Add the • ingredients to a small saucepan, and bring to a boil.
8.  Wipe the water from the desalted herring roe, and cut into pieces.
9.  Place the squid cut into thin strips, the konbu, the carrots, and herring roe into a bowl along with the cooled Step 7, and mix.
10.  Let sit in the fridge, stirring it around from time to time (if you keep nibbling at it to test the flavor, it'll be gone before you know it). After it has softened and turned an amber color and the konbu has turned sticky, it's done.
11.  I garnished the dish with julienned yuzu peel for aroma.
12.  It is best to eat it within 5 days to 1 week.
