Yummy Salmon cakes is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It is easy, it’s fast, it tastes delicious. It’s enjoyed by millions every day. Yummy Salmon cakes is something which I’ve loved my whole life. They are fine and they look fantastic.

To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have yummy salmon cakes using 10 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Yummy Salmon cakes:

1.  Make ready finely chopped bell or sweet peppers
2.  Prepare minced onion, or 1/4 cup chopped fresh onion
3.  Make ready refrigerated organic minced garlic
4.  Make ready tumeric
5.  Take cumin
6.  Make ready black pepper
7.  Get can of salmon (I used Royal Pink from Trident foods)
8.  Prepare egg
9.  Make ready panko breadcrumbs
10.  Take Drizzle of olive oil to coat pan

My mom used crushed soda crackers in place of the panko, but both ways are yummy. Salmon cakes are one of my go-to, emergency meals. Like other seafood "cakes," we want to use the minimum amount of filler. Just a touch of breadcrumb is all you need here, as the raw salmon is.

##### Instructions to make Yummy Salmon cakes:

1.  Add peppers, onion and garlic to a sautee pan and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl and let cool for a couple minutes while you gather then rest of the ingredients and oil the pan. (Keep the pan on medium heat)
2.  Add the salmon to the pepper mixture, using a fork to break up large chunks.
3.  Add the egg, then the spices, stir well - then add the bread crumbs. The texture should be wet, but stable enough to form a cake/burger that doesn't fall apart. Make them as big or small as you like, shapes are fun for kids!! \*Add bread crumbs to thicken, water to moisten.
4.  Cook cakes for about 5 minutes each side, then enjoy however you wish!!
5.  I just made the same recipe without the bell peppers and 1st step. I added some shredded carrot and grated parmesan cheese to the cake mixture and the cakes turned out wonderful!!!!!

Salmon cakes are tasty and filling. As long as you have canned salmon and eggs, you can whip them up anytime! These crispy salmon cakes are tasty and filling and incredibly easy to make. These salmon cakes made with leftover mashed potatoes and canned salmon are 'cheap and cheerful'. So you can eat your cakes and also… live a little!
