##### Steps to make Sublime Sake-Steamed Oysters:

1.  Wash the shucked oysters while gently shaking them in water (2 to 3 times). Put some salt water that's about as salty as sea water in a bowl, and soak the oysters in it.
2.  Bring an equal amount each of sake and water to a boil in a pan, to evaporate the alcohol. (The alcohol may flame up while it's cooking off, but the flames will disappear right away so don't panic.)
3.  Gently put the oysters in the sake-water liquid. When they have plumped up they are done! (You can use the cooking liquid for clear soups or chawanmushi (savory egg custard), or in oyster rice.)
4.  Put the grated daikon radish in a microwave-safe container and microwave for 1-2 minutes until it no longer tastes harsh. (It will be OK for small children this way too!) Serve the oysters while they're still warm topped with the grated daikon radish.
