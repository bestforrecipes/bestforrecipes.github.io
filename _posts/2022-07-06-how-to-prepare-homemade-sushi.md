2.  Now take nori sheet, place it on a plastic sheet, now spread flavoured rice on half of the nori sheet, then in the centre spread cheese spread, place 3 slices of carrots, 6 slices of tossed capsicum and slowly roll the sushi with help of plastic sheet into a firm roll.
3.  Cut the edges with a sharp knife & cut sushi into clean & meat pieces, then sprinkle black sesame seeds over each piece & serve it with soya sauce.
