Considered mainly as an Italian-American variant of the many fish and seafood stews in Italian cuisine, cioppino is also quite a popular dish for the holiday season, especially the Feast of the Seven Fishes. This is probably because you can combine several fish and seafood in the dish, shortening the quota for the number of dishes you need to prepare for the occasion. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.

1.  Heat olive oil and garlic in a large pot over medium-high heat for about 1 minute.

Add garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes and season with salt and pepper. I have been making this for so long, can't recall where it came from. Giada De Laurentiis' Cioppino, an Italian-American fisherman's stew, is a lighter alternative to heavy holiday meals, from Everyday Italian on Food Network. After doing a little research and finding recipes for cioppino seafood stew that used either chicken broth or clam juice, I decided to do a mix of the two. Even with the simplifying of a more traditional cioppino Italian seafood stew recipe, my Easy Cioppino Seafood Stew was very tasty.
