##### Steps to make Mike's Giant Seafood Stuffed Quahog Grilled Clams:

1.  Mix your stuffing well and heat. Use reserved clam juice if you feel your stuffing is too dry. You'll want it somewhat moist. No need to fry your stuffing if opting out of the fresh veggies. Just heat/steam in microwave.
2.  Dislodge clams from shell and put back into place. Reserve any fluids if you possibly can.
3.  If incorporating the fresh veggies, fry in butter until translucent. About 3 minutes for fine minced. Then add stuffing. My students opted for both versions.
4.  Pack stuffing tightly and generously on your raw giant clams. Grill for 7 minutes covered at 400°. Or, until they're bubbling. Add cheeses at the finish and allow to melt.
5.  Serve these delicious appetizers with hot sauces to the side. Garnish with fresh parsley. Enjoy!
