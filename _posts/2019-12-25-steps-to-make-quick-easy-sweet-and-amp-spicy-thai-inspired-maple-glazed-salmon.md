##### The ingredients needed to make Easy Sweet & Spicy Thai-Inspired Maple Glazed Salmon:

1.  Take roughly 1.75 pound salmon fillet
2.  Get salt & pepper to season
3.  Make ready oil for searing salmon
4.  Take large clove garlic, minced (just under a Tablespoon)
5.  Get shallots, thinly sliced
6.  Take stems cilantro, chopped (stems and leaves)
7.  Prepare a jalapeno, thinly sliced (or if you like hotter chilies, you can certainly use another kind)
8.  Prepare oil for the glaze
9.  Prepare maple syrup
10.  Make ready the zest of half a lime
11.  Get chili garlic paste (I use Huy Fong.)
12.  Make ready lime juice
13.  Prepare fish sauce

##### Steps to make Easy Sweet & Spicy Thai-Inspired Maple Glazed Salmon:

1.  Preheat the oven to 400F and prepare an oven safe dish or baking sheet to bake the salmon in. I like to line the dish with foil for easy removal and cleanup.
2.  Season the salmon on the flesh side with salt and pepper.
3.  In a medium bowl, combine all glaze ingredients and stir to mix thoroughly.
4.  In a non-stick pan, bring the 1 Tablespoon oil up to medium high temp and sear the salmon fillet for 2 minutes per side. I sear because because I like a crust on my fish, but if you don't care for it or don't have time, just rub the flesh side with a little bit of oil and go to the next step.
5.  Transfer the salmon to your oven-safe dish, skin-side down, and pour the glaze evenly on top.
6.  Bake the salmon on the center rack for 7 to 10 minutes, depending on how done you like your fish (the full 10 minutes if you didn't sear), then turn the oven to broil and place the salmon about 5 inches under the broiler and broil for another 4 or 5 minutes to caramelize the glaze. You can serve the whole fillet family style, or portion it out with a knife or spatula, pulling the flesh away from the skin.
7.  Enjoy!
