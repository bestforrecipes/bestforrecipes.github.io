##### Steps to make Pasta with salmon and cream cheese:

1.  Chopping the salmon fillets into rectangles or cubes is good. We're going to fry them slowly so they become soft. We'll want them to break apart when we stir them with the pasta. We'll also reserve a few chunks after frying for presentation purposes. I'd suggest removing the skin too, although it can be nice to keep a few with the skin to put on top when serving.
2.  Start cooking the pasta as per packet instructions. Tend towards al dente if you can
3.  Start frying the courgette on a pan with little oil. Wait until they've softened. Then add the salmon. Fry the salmon slowly. Only a little browning. We don't want to sear it. Give it about 5 minutes. Ensure the salmon pieces are cooked throughout.
4.  Once the pasta is done cooking, and once the salmon and courgette are done frying… Retain some of the pasta water in a mug. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot.
5.  Mix the cream cheese in to the pot, making sure all the pasta is coated lightly. Add a little more if needed, but don't overdo it if you've chosen a cream cheese that's on the stronger side.
6.  Mix most of the salmon pieces into the pan. Keep a few salmon pieces aside for later. Mix the pasta so that the salmon breaks apart. At this point I usually add some of the reserve pasta water into the pot to loosen the pasta up a bit. Use your judgement.
7.  Serve the pasta into two bowls, with a dusting of parmesan cheese on top. Add on top some of the reserved salmon pieces, for presentation. Some basil also looks nice, if you have some.
