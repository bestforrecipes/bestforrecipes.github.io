2.  Take a large stock pot and put the pork bones in it. Fill with water and boil for a few minutes and discard the water. Add 4.5lt of fresh water to the pork bones again and boil for an hour or longer. (The longer you boil the better the broth will be.)
3.  Peel shrimps. Put the peeled shells in the boiling broth. Broth will turn red from the shrimp shells (after around 20 mins). Remove the shells and pork bones from the broth.
4.  Add the tamarind powder, 1 tsp of shrimp paste, 3 tbsp of crab paste, 3 tbsp of sugar, 2 tbsp of salt, and 1 tbsp of black pepper into the broth and let it boil.

7.  Gently fold the crab meat with the shrimp mixture and ground pork until uniform.
8.  Boil the broth from above. When it is boiling take the meatball mixture and make free formed meatballs with a spoon putting them into the broth. Add the fried tofu at this point. The meatballs are cooked when they start floating to the top.
9.  For toppings, chop up the remaining green onions from the bunch and cilantro bunch – slice the remaining white onion thinly – quarter the limes.
