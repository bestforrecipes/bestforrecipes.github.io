##### Steps to make Tex's Simple Scampi Butty 🐠🍞:

1.  Slice the bread bun, and butter well
2.  I'm using Whitby langoustine scampi for my butty. Whitby's a Yorkshire coastal town, and the place where I've eaten the best fish & chips I ever had, and I've visited chippies all over England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales
3.  Fortunately, Whitby langoustine scampi are available frozen and ready breaded, so I just need to cook them. I'm going to deep-fry them straight from frozen. Just pop them in hot oil at 170-180°C/340-355°F for 2-2½ minutes
4.  Prep your veg
5.  Add a generous smear of tartar sauce to the base of the bun, then the lettuce, and a few of the chopped tomatoes, or a slice if using slices

7.  Finish off your scampi by frying off for a further 1½-2 minutes, and season with salt and vinegar
8.  Add straight to the sandwich, and squeeze on a little lemon juice. Finally, smear the top of the bun with another helping of tartar sauce
9.  Put on the lid and eat as a snack, or with chips/fries 🐠 🍟
10.  Whitby is also the town where Bram Stoker wrote, and set, 'Dracula'
11.  Remember how Dracula got to England? 'The Dimitry of Narva' was the inspiration for the shipwrecked vessel that brought Dracula to Yorkshire in 1887. And you can still see it's wreck today. I saw it first in the 1990s when I was camping near the edge of the cliff behind it. In the book, Stoker renamed the ship 'The Demeter of Varna'
