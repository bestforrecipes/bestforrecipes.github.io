##### Instructions to make Chicken and Seafood Paella:

1.  Light BBQ, once the flames have died down add a 15 inch paella pan to the grill, add the chopped chorizo and stir until starting to brown (2-3 minutes) remove from pan and set aside.
2.  Add additional oil if needed, add the diced chicken and sear until golden brown (about 6 minutes). Remove and add to chorizo.
3.  Add the onion and season it generously with sea salt and black pepper. Cook and stir until softened (about 5 minutes).
4.  Add the garlic, paprika and saffron and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds).
5.  Add the finely chopped tomatoes and cook until darkened (about 3 minutes). Add the rice and stir to coat.
6.  Add the chicken stock and stir to mix, ensure the rice is evenly distributed around the whole pan. And re-add the chicken and chorizo which was set aside. Do not stir the rice from this point onwards.
