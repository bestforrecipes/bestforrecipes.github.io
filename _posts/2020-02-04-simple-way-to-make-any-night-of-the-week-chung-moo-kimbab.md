##### Instructions to make Chung Moo Kimbab:

1.  After cutting the radish into slices of 1/5 inch. I dried them for 2 days in this apparatus.
2.  I did the same with the shredded ones.
3.  After the drying process, put the sliced radish in a bowl, sprinkle 1 tsp of sugar and 1 tsp of salt. Mix well. Set aside for 30 minutes. Do the same for the shredded ones.
4.  Meanwhile, soak the half-dried squid (or squids, depending on the size). Usually, the half-dried squids are smaller in size than the dried ones, and also more expensive. For the half- dried, soak for 15 minutes. For the dried ones, it might need to be soaked a little longer.
5.  Drain the radishes. Sliced ones and shredded ones separately.
6.  Cut the squids into slanted slices. It would be easier to chew.
7.  Squeeze some extra liquid off the radishes. In a bowl, put 1 tbsp of ground red pepper, 1 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of sugar, 1 tsp of minced garlic and 1 tsp of minced ginger. Some chopped green onions. Mix well. Put the sliced radish in and mix well. Put into a container. Keep in room temperature for 1 night. Put into refrigerator the next day.
