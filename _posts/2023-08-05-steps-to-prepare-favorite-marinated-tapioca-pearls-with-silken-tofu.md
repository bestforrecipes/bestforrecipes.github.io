3.  Get Extra Soy Sauce \*optional
4.  Get 2 small blocks Silken Tofu

Their cooked size is usually somewhere between a pea and a marble, and they're made with tapioca starch, which comes from the cassava root. Silken tofu can be used for more than eating as taho.

##### Steps to make Marinated Tapioca Pearls With Silken Tofu:

1.  If you don’t have ‘Mentsuyu’, make the sauce by combining 1 tablespoon Water, 1/8 teaspoon Dashi Powder, 2 tablespoons Soy Sauce and 1 tablespoon Mirin. \*Note: You could boil it if you want to reduce the alcohol of Mirin.
2.  Place plenty of Water in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Add Tapioca Pearls and cook over low heat, occasionally stirring, for 15 minutes or Tapioca Pearls are almost transparent. \*Note: Do not overcook Tapioca Pearls until completely transparent because they might dissolve in water. Follow the instruction on the package.
3.  Drain and rinse with cold water, the white spots in the Tapioca Pearls will mostly disappear, then drain well. Place in a bowl and cover with the sauce. Gently stir, check the flavour and add extra Soy Sauce if required. Keep in the fridge to marinate for 1/2 hour.
4.  Place a block of Silken Tofu on a plate, cover with Lettuce and Marinated Tapioca Pearls, sprinkle with Nori, Spring Onion and Toasted Sesame Seeds, and enjoy COLD.
