##### Instructions to make Szechuan Chicken Over Chilled Noodles (Bàng Bàng jī liáng miàn):

1.  Make the Chinese sesame paste. Dry roast the sesame seeds till fragrant. Finely grind the seeds with a mortar and pestle for 10 minutes.
2.  Heat the vegetable oil and sesame oil till it starts to smoke a little. Next add in the ground sesame seeds and mix until they form a smooth paste. Once it cools, the Chinese sesame paste is ready.
3.  Boil a large amount of water in a pot. Add in the chicken, green parts of the leek, and the ginger. Cook on low heat. Adjust the heat so that little bubbles start to rise and cook for 20 minutes.
4.  Soft-boil the eggs so that the yolks have just solidified. If you boil them for 8 minutes, you'll have perfectly soft-boiled eggs.
5.  Take the salted jellyfish and wash in water. Then let it soak for 30 minutes in the water till it's no longer salty.
6.  Finely chop the leek and then bring together all the ingredients for the sauce. Mix well to dissolve the ingredients.
7.  Cover the cucumber with a generous amount of salt and then roll it on a cutting board to salt it. Then cut it into 2 mm wide strips. It'll look pretty if all of the pieces have the same width and length. Cut the tomato into thin wedges.
8.  After 20 minutes, take out the chicken. Pierce it with a skewer. If clear juice comes out of the meat, it's done. Next, put it in ice water to chill well.
9.  After it's chilled completely, be sure to dry the meat properly. Cut off the meat from the bone and then cut it into 4~5 mm wide strips. When cutting, don't move the knife, but rather, chop it off.
10.  Boil the noodles in a generous amount of water for a little bit longer than instructed by the packet. Wash them with cold water to wash off the sliminess and then chill them well.
11.  Wring the noodles once you have drained it well. Pour the vinegar and oil on the noodles and gently mix together.
