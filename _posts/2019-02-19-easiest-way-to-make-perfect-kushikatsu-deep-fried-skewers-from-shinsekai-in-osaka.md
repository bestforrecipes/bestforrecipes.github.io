##### Steps to make Kushikatsu (Deep Fried Skewers) from Shinsekai in Osaka:

1.  Make fine panko first. Put panko in a sieve, and push through the mesh to make them fine.
2.  Next make the special sauce. Heat the red wine to evaporate the alcohol, add the bonito dashi stock, then honey and sugar and dissolve.
3.  Put in the rest of the sauce ingredients and bring to a brief boil to complete the sauce. Let cool.
4.  Next make the batter. Beat the egg, and combine with the milk and water. Add the flour to this and mix well. When there are no more lumps, add the grated yamaimo.
5.  The skewers should be less than 15 cm long. The most important point is to cut the skewered ingredients small. This way they will fry up quickly with a crispy finish, and will look good too!
6.  Cut beef round or chicken thigh meat into 2 cm cubes, and skewer 3 at a time. Squeeze the meat when they are on the skewer to even them out. Aim to put a bit less than 20 g of meat on a skewer.
7.  Spread out the pork slices neatly, season lightly with salt and pepper and wrap around the skewers. Squeeze the meat around the skewer to even it out. Sliced pork skewers are tender, delicious and inexpensive!
8.  Take the stem ends off the cherry tomatoes before skewering them. Poke several holes in them to prevent them from exploding when fried! Do this when the tomatoes are on the skewer.
9.  Take the shells and tail of the shrimp and de-vein. Cut the tips off the tails. Straighten out the shrimp and skewer them through from the head.
10.  Cut each chikuwa into 5 pieces and stuff with cheese. Skewer 2 pieces at a time.
11.  Cut up the cabbage roughly and wash.
12.  Dip the skewers in the batter. Shake off any excess batter, then coat the skewers in the panko. Once you have breaded about 10 skewers, start frying.
13.  Fry them quickly in 170°C oil. The vegetable skewers take about a minute, and the meat skewers take about 2 minutes to cook.
14.  When the skewers are golden brown and crispy, drain off the oil very well and put the skewers on a rack. When the oil has drained off completely transfer the skewers to a serving plate.
15.  Scoop out any panko left in the oil after each batch is fried. The panko are very fine, so use a tea strainer to remove them until the oil is clean.
16.  Dip the skewers completely in the special sauce. Dip the cut cabbage that's served with the skewers in the sauce too! Beer is the drink to serve with this!
17.  Today I fried quail eggs, cherry tomatoes, lotus root, shrimp, chikuwa stuffed with cheese, beef round, thinly sliced pork, okra, eggplant, chicken thigh meat, and asparagus.
18.  These are authentic kushikatsu from a famous restaurant in Shinsekai. They were amazingly yummy!
