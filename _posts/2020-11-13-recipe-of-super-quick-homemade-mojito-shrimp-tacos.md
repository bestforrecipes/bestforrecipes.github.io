##### The ingredients needed to make Mojito Shrimp Tacos:

The Mojito-Lime Shrimp Tacos were fantastic and they have a decent selection of draft beer, that is less expensive than surrounding places (Natty Greene Buckshot Amber was my choice). The Yucca Fries and Rosa Sauce was a great compliment! Even though all seating is outside it was very comfortable. Add the reserved marinade and bring liquid to a simmer.

##### Instructions to make Mojito Shrimp Tacos:

1.  Heat 1 Tbsp of olive oil in a large sauté pan and add onions and peppers on medium high.
2.  Sauté until onions become translucent. Place onions and peppers aside.
3.  In a small bowl add lime, Tequila, 1/2 Tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper, and mint. Mix until well blended.
4.  Add shrimp to pan. Cook until a red color starts to appear.
5.  Add Lime sauce and sauté until shrimp becomes bright red. Return onions and peppers and cook for additional 2 minutes on high heat.
6.  Remove from heat. Place a portioned mix of shrimp on small flour tortillas and garnish with chopped Lettuce, sprinkled Monterrey cheese and a Lime wedge.
7.  This dish can be served with my Baja Black Beans & Corn. Just heat a can of rinsed Black Beans with a can of Corn and squeeze a half a Lime and add 1/4 cup of your favorite salsa; spicy works great!

Must come in and taste for yourself. Build tacos: add a scoop of slaw, a few shrimp, and a drizzle of the garlic-lime mayo to each taco. It's balanced enough to stand up to an amalgam of flavors, and its cooling mint will tame the heat if you don't like things extra spicy. For these tacos you're firing up the grill and skewering up the shrimp for best results! First marinade the shrimp in a lime, cayenne concoction.
