Okonomiyaki is a savoury pancake that is mixed with vegetables and proteins and grilled. However, this recipe is not based on that traditional style of okonomiyaki. Instead, it's inspired by a recipe that became a family staple, the tofu okonomiyaki recipe I found in Chatelaine magazine years back. These trendy Japanese savoury pancakes are made with cabbage and okonomiyaki sauce.

##### Instructions to make Easy and Microwaved Flour-free Okonomiyaki with Tofu:

1.  Line 2 heatproof dishes with plastic wrap, removing any air pockets. You don't need to line the plates if you don't want to turn over the okonomiyaki.
2.  Finely shred the cabbage. Cut the bacon into 1 cm pieces. Put the tofu (no need to strain out the water completely) in a bowl, and mix with a whisk until it's smooth and creamy.
3.  Add the eggs, salt and pepper to the bowl and mix well.
4.  Add the cabbage, bacon and cheese, and mix very well. I recommend using your hands to do this, while pushing on the mixture.
5.  Pour the batter into the plates you made ready in Step 1. Cover with more plastic wrap, and poke some air holes through it. Microwave for 6 minutes at 600 W (per plate).
6.  Turn the pancake over onto a serving plate, add the toppings and it's done!
7.  I tried making it with a Lekué microwave container. If you have a silicone steamer or container made especially for microwave cooking, give it a try!

Mix all the sauce ingredients together. Put the plain flour in a large bowl. Whisk in the egg and the cooled chicken stock to make a batter. Okonomiyaki are traditional Japanese fritter-like pancakes that are great for using up a head of white cabbage. Serve with okonomiyaki sauce, Japanese mayonnaise or your favourite hot sauce.
