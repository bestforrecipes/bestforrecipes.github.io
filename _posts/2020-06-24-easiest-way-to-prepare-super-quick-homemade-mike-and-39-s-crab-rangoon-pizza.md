##### Instructions to make Mike's Crab Rangoon Pizza:

1.  Bring cream cheese and mozzarella to room temperature or just \[slightly\] warm in microwave.
2.  Mix everything together in a bowl. Except for anything that says, "reserve half." Or, your purple onions, sweet chili sauce, hot mustard, wontons and oil in a bowl. Look closely at the ingredient section for any clarification.
3.  Smear your cream cheese spread evenly atop of your pre-made crust\[s\].
4.  Smear a thin layer of sweet chili sauce atop the cream cheese. This chili sauce can seriously over dominate your pizza - flavor wise - so don't overdue it. Unless of course, you prefer it as a primary flavor. Lightly smear your hot mustard to taste and evenly sprinkle on your remaining crab meat.
5.  Add your thin sliced purple onions and your reserved green onions, red pepper flakes and mozzarella cheese.
6.  Thin slice your wontons and fry in hot oil for about 30 seconds - just until they're just slightly browned and crispy. They'll brown more as they dry. Don't over fry. Place on clean napkins to drain oil then, place them on your pizza.
7.  Bake on a pizza stone or cookie sheet at 425° for 25 minutes. Or, until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbling.
8.  Slice and serve hot with ice cold beers. Enjoy!
