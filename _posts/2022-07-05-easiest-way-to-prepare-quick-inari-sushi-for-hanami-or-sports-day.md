2.  Prepare the seasoning in a saucepan. When the ingredients marked with a ○ come to a boil, add the aburaage. Place an otoshibuta (drop lid) directly on the boiling sauce with the aburaage slices and lower the heat. Cook until the sauce is almost gone.
3.  Make the sushi rice. Mix in the sushi vinegar, white sesame and the pickled ginger thoroughly into rice that was cooked slightly firmer for sushi. Cool the rice down using a flat fan.
4.  Moisten your hands with some of the sauce the aburaage was cooked in and lightly squeeze the rice into cylinder shapes. Put it inside the aburaage, taking care not to tear it. Seal the aburaage by tucking one side in to cover the rice and folding the other side over it.
5.  Adjust the shape of the sushi. Place them open side down on a plate and serve.
