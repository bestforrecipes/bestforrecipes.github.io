11.  Make ready 2 dash worcestershire sauce
12.  Prepare fresh sliced jalape√±os _(optional - i made a few with & a few without)_

##### Steps to make Skinny Girl Crab Rangoon Bombs:

1.  Place all 3 cream cheese bricks into a bowl and warm slightly in the microwave so they are soft & pliable
2.  The goods!
3.  Once you are able to mix the cream cheese around easily with a fork, add the ricotta.
4.  Slice the green onion into thin discs using a sharp knife. Add to cheese mixture.
5.  Next, add the garlic & onion powder, as well as the Worcestershire sauce and blend together.
6.  Slice crab meat into tiny little pieces and add to mixture. Blend well.
7.  Once your mixture is ready, set up your "station" with a spoon for scooping, a plate in front of you, the wrappers next to u, and the bowl of water accessible. \*Grab a sharp paring knife.
8.  Prepare a baking sheet sprayed well with PAM.
9.  Lay a wrapper on the plate, spoon some mixture into the middle of the wrapper, & use your fingers to dip in the water and wet all 4 edges of the wrap. Fold it over into a triangle and press firmly to ensure that your edges are secure; "glued together", if you will.
10.  NOW, use the paring knife to trim the excess wrapper off to make them look ascetically pleasing. Just make sure to leave enough room so that the edges stay "glued" together. Transfer to your baking sheet and preheat your oven to 325¬∞.
11.  Repeat this process until all mixture is used. ‚≠êSpray the tops of your rangoons with PAM before placing them in the oven ‚≠ê
12.  Bake for about 15 minutes, or until slightly browned. Allow to cool, as they will be molten üåã
