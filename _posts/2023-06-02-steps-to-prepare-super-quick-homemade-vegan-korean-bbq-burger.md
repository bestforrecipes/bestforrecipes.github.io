2.  Prepare the kimchi ketchup. - Blitz kimchi, ketchup, chili paste and maple syrup in a blender until smooth. - Transfer into a bowl. - Add nori flakes, lemon zest and juice. - Mix until well combined. - Taste and adjust for sweetness and spiciness. - Set aside in the fridge until ready to use.

4.  Prepare the burger. - In a skillet over medium heat, drizzle some sesame oil. - Once the oil is heated up, add in 2 patties. - Add in the crushed garlic, 1/2" ginger and 1 stalk of scallion. - _You can crush them with a back of a knife._
5.  Brush the patties with the bbq sauce. - Cook until the bottom is crispy brown. - Flip and brush the patties with some more bbq sauce. - Baste the patties with all the liquid. - Cook until the bottom is crispy brown. - Remove from heat and set aside on a plate with all the crushed aromatics.
6.  Brush the patties again with more bbq sauce. - Repeat the steps for the remaining patties. - _By cooking the patties in batches will prevent overcrowding of the skillet, which will create steam rather than searing and cooking._ - Slice the mushroom lengthwise into 4 slices. - You should have a total of 8 slices.
7.  In the same skillet, drizzle some sesame oil. - Place in the mushroom slices. - Again, you can do this in batches. - Brush the mushrooms with bbq sauce. - Cook until the bottom is lightly caramelized. - Flip and brush with more bbq sauce.
8.  Slice burger buns into 3 tiers. - Toast the buns in the same skillet. - Once all the patties and mushrooms have been cooked, buns have been toasted, in the same skillet, pour in the remaining bbq sauce. - Deglaze and reduce slightly until thick consistency. It should coat the back of a spoon. - Remove from heat and transfer into a bowl.
9.  Assemble the burger. - Smear kimchi ketchup on the bottom buns. - Add some kimchi over the top. - Place the patties over the kimchi and drizzle some reduced bbq sauce over the top. - Scatter some scallions.
10.  Add on the 2nd tiers and smear on some more kimchi ketchup. - Followed by 2 slices of mushrooms each. - Drizzle some reduced bbq sauce over the top and some scallions. - Close the top of the burger buns. - Serve immediately.
