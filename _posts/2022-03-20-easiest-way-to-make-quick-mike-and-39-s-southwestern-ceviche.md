##### Steps to make Mike's Southwestern Ceviche:

1.  Here's what you'll need. Use only the most crisp, chilled, fresh vegetables, juices and seafood you can find. In fact, overly firm, crisp vegetables is exactly what you're looking for.
2.  Place your chopped onions, jalapeños, all bell peppers and Anaheim peppers in a seperate bowl for thirty minutes refrigerated. Add the juice and zest of one lime, one lemon and one orange to both season and cook your hard vegetables.
3.  Gently mix all vegetables together. Add additional 1/4 cup lime juice.
4.  Add your Clamato \[enough to cover vegetables\] and a good splash of Spicy V8 Juice. Also, add all of your seasonings. Again, gently mix well. You don't want to bruise your fresh vegetables.
5.  Fresh shrimp, scallops, crab meat and tuna dethawed pictured. Tails removed from shrimp. Do not use real crab meat unless you're planning on the entire bowl being consumed in one afternoon or evening sitting. Otherwise, your Ceviche will go south twice as fast. Even while being refrigerated. It will also murk up your broth.
6.  Imitation Crab Meat pictured. \[aka white fish\]
7.  Sun Dried Tomatoes in oil pictured.
8.  Add all of your vegetables and seafood, plus additional Clamato and Tabasco if needed to fully cover your ingredients.
9.  Gently fold everything together well. Do not add avocados to your main bowl. Always serve them to the side. Otherwise it will murk up your Ceviche broth. Chill for 3 hours. Know this dish will get better as she rests and chills. Even 3 days later. Gently stir occasionally.
10.  Serve with quality crackers, flour tortillas, additional Tabasco Sauce, fresh avocado slices and ice cold Mexican beer.
11.  Enjoy!
