5.  Get 1 mayonnaise (egg-free recipe in my profile)

##### Instructions to make Vickys Dressed Crab, Gluten, Dairy, Egg & Soy-Free:

1.  Boil a large pan of water and add the crab. Cook for 20 - 30 minutes then remove from the pan and let the water drain out of the crab by propping it up head down
2.  Once the crab has cooled, twist off the legs where they meet the body, pull off the claws and separate the body by placing it on it's back and placing your hands under the edge and pushing upwards until it breaks. You'll possibly need a knife to lever it
3.  Remove the spongy dead mans fingers, the stomach sac and the hard membranes from under the shell and discard. Drain off any water
4.  Remove the brown meat to a bowl and mash it with a fork. Break open the claws and remove the white meat to another bowl. Cut the crab body in half and pick out the rest of the white meat inside. If the legs are thick it's worth cracking them also and removing the meat. Flake the white meat and check through for pieces of shell
5.  Break off the outer edges of the crab shell to form a dish for serving the meat
6.  Spoon the meat back into the shell to serve and accompany with some good quality mayonaisse, brown bread, a wedge of lemon for squeezing over the meat and a little parsley
