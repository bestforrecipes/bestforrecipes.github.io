##### The ingredients needed to make Soup Base - Seafood, Fish Or Vegetable:

2.  Let reduce to about 2 cups of water over low to medium heat. If you are watching it then you can use higher temperatures.
3.  Add rest of water and reduce to about 1 quart.
4.  Using a sieve or colander with cheese cloth (or even a cotton towel) filter out all the chunks of material.
5.  Using a smaller pot continue to reduce to stock further till the boiling bubbles start to last longer and the liquid becomes syrup like.
6.  At this point you can reduce it slowly to make it more thick. Though I just let it cool and put in a small jar in the fridge. This will last up to 2 months in the fridge. Maybe longer. But I use mine up pretty fast.
