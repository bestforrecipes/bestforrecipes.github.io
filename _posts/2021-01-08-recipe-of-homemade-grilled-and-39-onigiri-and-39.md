Today's onigiri is grilled, typically on a frying pan or over a barbecue grill. Traditionally, Yaki Onigiri is grilled over charcoal, which lends the rice balls a hint of woodsy, smoky flavor that is truly hard to resist. To make Yaki Onigiri at home, I use a cast iron pan to grill the rice balls instead.

To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook grilled 'onigiri' using 6 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook it.

With this easy recipe you will be able to prepare perfect yaki onigiri for bento lunches, appetisers, or snacks. Onigiri is a classic staple dish in Japan that most Japanese people pack in their bento boxes or buy from the convenience store for lunch. I don't know why, but Onigiri just tastes so much better than plain rice in a bowl, even though it's just that very same rice rolled into a triangle shape.

##### Instructions to make Grilled 'Onigiri':
